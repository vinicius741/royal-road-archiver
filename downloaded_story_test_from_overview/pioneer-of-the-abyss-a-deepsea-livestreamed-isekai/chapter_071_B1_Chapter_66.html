<h1>B1 | Chapter 66</h1>
<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNmOWIzZThmNDM3YjQ0Mjk5ZThlZDgzZTBhMWRkNGQx" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>The Grand Office of the Alliance</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNiYTMwMzA5MjdlYjQzZWU4MjcyZDBhZWYxMzVlZmZl">The Grand Chancellor of the Alliance calmly taps his finger on his desk as the two Bloodliners argue in front of him.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDQyMjZlOGNkNTQ3MmE5YTM5YTE4ZTBjMTgyYzE4">“How long are you going to act like this, Blubber?! Just give it up! The feud between our Bloodlines has been long overdue for an end!” Kaelthas Azuranth shouts as his eyes clearly show his Kraken Bloodline to all who are watching. Which is just the Grand Chancellor and the Abyssal Orca.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjZlZjI4OTJhMDQ2MWQ5OTI5YTRhZmVmYjIzMjJk">“Your family may have ended the feud with my parents, and we may not be fighting anymore,” Seravos Orcayne growls out as he glares at Kaelthas with his own eyes transformed as well. “But none of that means we are friends, nor will I allow my granddaughter to take on your filthy name.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzBkNTEzZmRiMTQ0YTg5Njg0NzQ4MzE1MTJmYzEx">The two continue to argue as the Grand Chancellor watches them while sipping tea. With more than a small part of him wanting to kick both of them out of his office.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2QxZGU1NjlkODQyMTRiY2ExMjFhZDc2OWE2ZGI4">If it were anyone else, he’d just kill them.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWE1ZWQzODVjYzRlYzNiYzhiYTcyZTdmZWU5ODgy">But these two are Bloodliners. And not just that but they’re the two strongest Bloodliners in the entire Alliance. On top of being the patriarchs of the two strongest Bloodline families.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDRkNWM5Y2IyYjQxNDQ5NzNmYTk5ZjYzY2FiNWZl">So even if he wanted to kill them, he wouldn’t be able to.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzk2MDlmYzI3OTQ0ZTFiZWQ0MTJiYzgzN2U1YTIx">System Administrator or no System Administrator. These two are too powerful for even him to handle.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjhjZWU5ZDZlMTQ0MGFhNzg1N2VlOWYyZjMyZTEy">After all, his status as System Administrator doesn’t grant him anywhere near as much power as a lot of people suspect. He can only do minor things like alter some messages when close to someone, temporarily disable a skill, and, among several other things, suggest things to the System in the hopes that the System decides to approve of his suggestions. Like the Pioneer System.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2FjNTYzOWJiOTRlZTZiN2M2YWU3ZjRmMjg5MWM0">The only reason he is still the leader is because he acquiesces to Bloodliners’ requests sometimes. Because either one of them is stronger than him.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2M3YzRkNDUzMDQ3MDk4NWJjZjQ1MzkzOGI1NjQy">Although part of their reasoning for not challenging him is because of their lack of ambition.</p>
<p class="cnM5OWFkNzA2ZTIxYTQ2MGZiNmZhZWMwNzAzMDkzZDc5">Neither family cares about anything outside of the Abyss and their own family.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDZkMzI0ZTdkNDQ2N2Q4ZmI2MWE4MzY4NjdmYWEy">And the other Bloodliner families are all too weak to challenge him.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDA2MDk2NjA2YTQ3NjFhNDM4ZGNiYTc1Y2NiNDgx">More importantly, the Krakens have been spending so long in the Abyss everyone is assuming they went extinct down there. Even if he knows better.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjM0NmNlM2I1NDQwNDJiOTViZmIwMDE4NTRmZDI3">Other than that, the Grand Chancellor’s System Administrator status is also a deterrent as, while it isn’t able to do as much as he wants, it is enough to allow him to ruin their families in a few ways before they kill him. So they no doubt hold back a lot because of that as well.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTBhMTlkMWMyNTQ1NmY4OGY3OTI2MWM1ODI3OTlk">After the two continue arguing for an entire ten minutes, they both turn their attention towards the Grand Chancellor, making sweat begin dripping down his back.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzNiZDU1MDU2YjRhYmE5NTQ5NGYzOWM0OTkxYjhl">“How long will it take to remove her from the Pioneer System?” “Remove her from the System now.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MzMwNmFlMmRiMzQ0Mjk5Njk4MjA2NjA0YjU1YTdh">The Grand Chancellor feels shaken as he wonders just what brought this on out of nowhere. Only to see a video on a phone in front of the two that he missed. One showing Aqua as she was manhandled by some random native peasant.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzY2ZWFiNmZiODQxZjBiNzFhNjhkYmRhZjcxYWM1">“If she is removed from the Pioneer System, the disgusting filth of the Alliance will no longer be able to watch her, and the world of Oceana should be considered cleared for Alliance interference,” Kaelthas says, his emotionless voice sending chills down the Grand Chancellor’s spine. “Then I’ll be able to take care of that creature.”</p><span class="cjc3ZmVlZDdhNmE3MjRjMjM4ZDFkZTY4YjZlNGI4YmNl"><br/>The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4NGI1OWUwNjRmYjRlZGU5MWUxMTZmNjcwMjI3MGVj">“For the first time in as long as I can remember, we agree on something,” Seravos says with a nod as his eyes narrow at the sight of the blacksmith in the video. “Take her out of the System. I want to deal with this disgusting piece of filth and to get your disgusting Alliance to stop watching her every move.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZjczMmFhMTk0ZjRhYjQ5OWZkMDU1NWU5ZDY3Y2Yz">“With all sincerity, I cannot do as you request,” the Grand Chancellor states, making both of the grandparents upset about their granddaughter exposing themselves to the entire Alliance turn to glare at him. So he hurriedly adds, “The System controls that. I can’t do a thing about this. All I was able to do was suggest adding the feature to the System. I wasn’t able to get any control over the feature.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYTcyZmExMjgxZDQ4MWZiNDllNDg3NGE4YmYxMjNh">Both Bloodliners stare at him as if trying to stare holes through him.</p>
<p class="cnM1YmMyM2JhODFlNjRjOTI4MGQwYTc5YWEwMDI0OTFm">A headache begins to form as the Grand Chancellor for the first time regrets choosing Equeter as this latest batch of Pioneers.</p>
<p class="cnMzNGM3YWU1OGU4MjRmN2RhYmI5ZjJkZmRjNTI2ODJm"><em>It’s their own damned fault for letting their granddaughter run around as an orphan in the first place, so why am I stuck in the middle of their feud?!</em></p>
<p class="cnMyNzhlYjQ4ZWEzMjQyYmRiYTU2YjY2NjI1ODViNmQ1">“Then officially approve Aqua’s name change request to Aqua Azuranth this instant and I will forgive you for this matter for the moment,” Kaelthas orders, his eyes narrowing on the Grand Chancellor.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2U3YzgwNTk1MDQ0MDZiZDE1NDc2OWM4MThmOWY1">The Grand Chancellor opens his mouth to speak, only for the General of the Military to calmly declare, “If you do that, I will feed you alive to my great granduncle.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmJmNjA1MTYxMDRhMmI4OTJkMzlkY2Q5ZjQ5MmJk">And the Grand Chancellor closes his mouth again. Deciding that he doesn’t want to have anything to do with the publicly known long-since insane member of the Orcayne family who is locked away deep in the Abyss.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2IxM2VlYTZmZjQ3M2NiNmJiNTg1M2U3YzcwNjk1">“I’ll drag you to the Abyss personally and take you on a tour of the middle layer as you’ve mentioned you wanted to learn about,” Kaelthas declares without batting an eye.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWQ4NjZiNmJmMDQ4YWVhYWVkODRhNjdkMWI4ZGE1">Then, before the Grand Chancellor can even say anything in response, Seravos follows it up with, “I’ll flood your entire home planet before dragging your family into the Abyss myself to feed to the middle layer monsters.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNDBjZDc4OWFhNjQ4NjdiNjhjYTlkMTUyZGU1ODIz">And one after another, the two Bloodliners take turns threatening the Grand Chancellor, making the tyrant of the Alliance almost want to cry at this situation. But he knows two things.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTU1MDdmZjBmNTQyOWViYTY4NWM2ZGQ0ZWJkMDY5">Two things that save him from the situation.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTI4ZmJkOWFmZDRjODZhYjlmMjFlNjRiODA5ZTlm">“Kaelthas, as long as you promise to protect me, I will accept your request,” the Grand Chancellor declares, choosing to ignore the general of his own military in this situation. Since he knows Kaelthas is significantly more reasonable than the latter.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTQxM2U4NzM3OTQ0ZWViYmI5Y2M2Mzg5ZDE2YWRl">And joining the unstable side is not the good choice here.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDExNWNhZDkwNzQyMzhhYmQyZjg2YjMxMmQ5MjVk">Then he turns towards Seravos after seeing Kaelthas grin and accept his condition before telling him, “We have already received a request from the Hydra Bloodline family Matriarch and heir making the same request. One originating from Aqua herself. And with two Bloodline families and the one whose name will be changed all agreeing, the change will go through.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZjM1MDAzZTk1MTQxODBiZmU5YzkzMjE2Mjg2NzYx">Seravos begins to leak water all throughout the room, making the Grand Chancellor immediately create several magical barriers around the important documents in the room. Keeping them dry in the process.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDUyYWI1OTU1NzQ1ZjA4NjZkMmFlNDUzZDU0YWNh"><em>If the Hydras weren’t in on this as well, I would be in trouble… thank the System for their interference.</em></p>
<p class="cnM2MjUzZmJiY2ExZTQzNjA4NDgwMmNhOTVlNzMwNmU2">He lets out a sigh before deciding to try changing the topic as he says, “Why don’t we see what Aqua is doing right now?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjRlNTQ1OTMyYzQ2NzRhNmVlNzJkNzNhY2JlMjVk">Both the Bloodliners in the room blink at the sudden turn before a large screen appears in front of them.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzg0NDMzYmE0NDQzMTFiZTVhYzYzMzc1MWI5NTc1"><em>Please don’t let her be in danger or getting groped again… for my life and the lives of my family, please…</em></p>
<p class="cnNlNzE3YTg2ZmQwYzQyOTBhMGZiNGVjOTdmYjc2ZWM2">Everyone else on his planet can die for all he cares. But his own life and that of his family?</p>
<p class="cnM1MTVlZDY3ZDYwZjQ5NGZiMWU2MjQ5YWVkMzI2NjE2">Fortunately for him, when the screen turns on, they just find Aqua watching two large monsters fight it out. While holding her fists in front of her looking almost like she’s cheering for them. Even going to the lengths of nodding her head in a cute manner a couple times, seemingly without even realizing that she’s doing it.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGU2YjhkNmMxMTQ3MjZhN2RhZGRlNzFiZjg4OWM3">“Seems she’s enjoying herself,” the Grand Chancellor says out loud with a smile on his face, feeling ever so grateful for the girl right now.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTIxOGY5YTkzNzQzN2M4ZGVmOWZmYTNiZjkwYTBj">Especially when he sees both faces of both Bloodliners – one of whom is usually emotionless and the other cold as ice – melt into warm smiles at the sight of their adorable granddaughter doing something so cute.</p>
<p class="cnM2M2RjNTRkMTA4YTRmYjZhNzgyMTU0OGE5N2I0NDAx">The Grand Chancellor bows his head towards the screen while muttering a thank you in his heart for the girl and her antics.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjBmM2NjYWYwMjQyYmFhY2I2ZWM1ZDYyNmQ1YjRk"><em>Maybe I should sponsor her something as thanks…</em></p>
<p class="cnM2OWI4ZTVjZWEyZTQ0OWM5OTYzNDMxZDE2NzM4MTdi">He furrows his brows for a few seconds in thought before coming to a decision.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjhjZGRhOTEzZDQ2ZDNhMDRlYmQ1M2IyNjczYzFj"><em>Right. I’ll give her that.</em></p>
<p class="cnM1YWQwMTcwZGJmZDRkYjI5ZGI5NzRmZjBiMzJkZDBm">The Grand Chancellor begins sending some texts to prepare his gift. Then he goes into the System’s Sponsorship System menu to set up the custom sponsorship option. Even paying a massive fortune to use it.</p>
<p class="cnMzYmYxZDdkMmM4MjRiYzRhMWI3ZjhmN2RkNTgwY2Y5">All while the two grandfathers continue watching their granddaughter on the screen acting adorable while watching the two monsters fight.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTBmZjdjZDQyMzRmNzdhMmRlMTYzODllMThlOGI2"><em>How did those two manage to leave this girl abandoned as an orphan for twenty years anyways…</em></p>
<p class="cnMwYzljMmY2YjViMjRjNTU5OGY1NmNmMDc2ZmNhZGU1">He can’t wrap his head around that as he watches them openly adore their granddaughter.</p>
