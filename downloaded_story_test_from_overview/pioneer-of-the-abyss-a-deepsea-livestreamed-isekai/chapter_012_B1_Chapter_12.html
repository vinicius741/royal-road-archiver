<p class="cnNmNzBhZDhhOGUyOTRmNzE5ZTBiMmVkYzdhYmM5OGQw" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aqua</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM4ODc0ZDgwNzNhYjQwNDk5NzhjNjlmNTRkMzMzZmQx">It only takes a single minute after entering the tunnel to find some rather unexpected sights. With the first being a couple sharks feeding on what looks like an orc. Just floating in the middle of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTFkYmJhMzA4ZTQxMGI5OTk5MDBmMTY0MjAxODg5">Huh?</p>
<p class="cnNhMGM3NDE2ZTFjZjQ2OGNiY2E4NDU1MTM5NDcwZTUz">Does that mean this Gate has orcs?</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2JiODJjOWNhMzQwMjBiZjQ1Y2M4YzdhZjEzNDEx">I’m absolutely sure it’s a Gate now though just from the sight of that orc corpse. After all, the only way a familiar monster would be on an unfamiliar planet is through a Gate. Plus the chance of an orc spawning in the deepsea even if it were an orc’s normal home planet is… rather slim to none. Actually it’s just none.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2JjZjExZjQ4MTQ1YzViYWYyM2UyZTFlMGEzNzAz">This orc clearly drowned before being turned into fish food.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzkyYTI4ZmU1MjQ2OGM4MGQ0MWNiYzYyZjQ0NTcy">Literally.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGFjYTAzZjMyYjRhODQ5OTkwMWVhNWVlZTRiYjUx">Anyway, I go ahead and slaughter the sharks without much trouble thanks to my level being four levels above the sharks’ levels. On top of my strength being so much higher at that.</p>
<p class="cnM1N2VhNzk3ZmM0ZjRkOTBhNWQ3MTI5YzQwOGMyYmVh">And after dealing with those sharks, I continue on through the tunnel. Finding a few more orc corpses along the way with more fish feasting away on them.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzAwMmY1MTljNDRhZGJiNzBlMGJmMWE1OGI0Mjdj">I deal with all the fish monsters I find without any trouble as the mana level continues to rise.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDhhNzk1NjZiYjRmNWNiZGRjODkzMGVkYTA5Nzdi">But as I get further into the tunnel, things begin to take a turn. The fish monsters start growing in level to the point they’re starting to match my own level, and their species type are changing as well.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTY0NWM3MDZjZjRhOWRhODE0NmIzY2I5MmVhMDI3">I narrow my eyes when I turn a corner in the tunnel to find a large jellyfish. One that is glowing purple and red in color with electricity running through the water around it.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDIwMmNjMzQzYjRkMWY4NzUxNjcyMzAyYjFiODg1"><strong>[Deepsea Poisonous Bloodzap Jelly – Level 9]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM2Mjc1NTVjODM0NDQyZjg5ZTI2MzE2M2YxMTkwNjcy">This one is even a higher level than me…</p>
<p class="cnM2OGRiNjQwYzM3OTRkZTlhNjU2NjU4Y2JmNDllMzRi">I tap my finger against the trident as I try to think of a way to handle this monster. Since the electricity around it is covering the entire tunnel in front of me. Blocking me from getting further.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDUxNTZlNDEyZDRlY2ZhYTk0ZTM2OGJiZWI1ZDgz">Then an idea comes to mind, and I go ahead and get a bit closer before activating my skill. Summoning forth a tentacle just a couple meters away from the jellyfish.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2UxYmI0NjlmOTQ0ZDU4YWZmMjU5NWE2MjBmOGQ2">And without any hesitation, I have the tentacle swat at the jellyfish, making electricity run throughout the tentacle as it does so. But despite that it continues to fall, hitting the jellyfish and slamming it straight down to the ground of the tunnel. Turning it into a literal paste on the ground.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDM5ZGRjODliNjQxNGY4MTE3OWE5Y2VkYTU3NWU1">Cool. Guess jellyfish aren’t very strong physically.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzg4NDgwMDdmODQxNmRhMWJhNjVjMWFkYjUzM2I4">Just like their appearance would suggest.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGJhODMwM2YyYTQyNTk4OTczOTNkNDZhNzcxYzIy">And with the jellyfish’s death, a few System Messages appear in my vision.</p>
<p class="cnM1Njc0MjU4NjIzMDQwZTU5OTAxYjk4NGZmMzgxZDUx"><strong>[You have killed a level nine Deepsea Poisonous Bloodzap Jelly. EXP has been granted accordingly.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNlMmVkZTVhZDJhYjRhZDM4ZDcyMDlkZWY5Njc0MDU1"><strong>[You have killed a creature underwater. Apex Predator of the Depths has been activated, increasing your REGEN stat by one.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNlYjE5YWY3MGM5OTRiMTBiNzAyNDBlMGMyYjA5M2M1"><strong>[Congratulations! You have now reached level 8! Your total free points have increased by two, and your mana stat has increased by ten. Allocate the free points whenever you please.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM5Mjc4YzY5YzZkYzRhMDdhMzAzYmUwNzZhYWQwN2Qy">Nice.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzMwZGVlOTI3ODRjMWViZTRhNWQ5MmNmYjU5NDkw">I go ahead and allocate the two free points to dexterity and strength respectively. Since constitution isn’t as big of an issue now that I’m healed and have my REGEN stat pretty high.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjUxNzM4YjIwMDQzY2E4ODE3ZWI5YmYyNjFjOTFm">And with that dealt with, I look to my next problem. Which is the purple liquid moving through the tunnel around the jellyfish’s corpse. Liquid that I get the feeling may be poisoned.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTMyZDNlYWI5ZDQ1NGY4ZjIxNWZiZTgxYTJmZDJh">Considering the jellyfish’s name includes poisonous in it.</p>
<p class="cnMzZGZhYzY5NTg2OTRlNmU5MzA5ZDgzZjI2ZjQ2NWRi">After contemplating for a moment, I just try to move as far away from the poison as I can, at the other end of the tunnel from it. And through that I manage to pass by without getting poisoned.</p><span class="cjZlYTQxMWRkNWI0NzQwYzQ5ZmMzMGQxMTcyMDg3NzQ0"><br/>This narrative has been purloined without the author's approval. Report any appearances on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMzZmZjYTQzMjUwNjRjYmNhYTYxOWU0MTMwM2UxNmJm">Or at least I don’t feel anything that would imply I was poisoned.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjBiNzAwNmQ3NjQ1YTY4MTUwNTNmMGY5YzBkYzdm">Regardless, I continue moving through the tunnel. Only occasionally running into other monsters.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTJmZGVhN2YyOTRjNTNhMTlmYmRlYTM2OGEyODA5">All the way until I find another cavern.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjk1ZTk3NTA3ZTRiMWZiNTM5MjMwZTY3Zjk2OTZh">And this cavern is… not a safe place, that’s for sure. It’s filled to the brim with sharks. Dozens of them, all of different species. And on top of that, there seems to be some sort of ruins-like structures down here. Even with some debris floating around amidst the sharks.</p>
<p class="cnM0MWQ4ZDI3ZDM4NDQwNDA4NTliMmU0ZDFlNGE1MGQ4">I stay safely at the entrance while identifying some of the many sharks swimming through the place.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDQ0ZWU4MGU5NzQ1OTZiZWE1NTMxZTI2NjA2YjBk"><strong>[Deepsea Angler Shark – Level 5]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMyNmQ0ODAzZWU0ZjQ1YThhNzI5NDQwMjM3NzkyMTJl"><strong>[Deepsea Horned Shark – Level 5]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM3Y2NlNTdjNDA3ZjQzY2JiM2E1OTMwNzIyZmNiYjMy"><strong>[Deepsea Hammer Shark – Level 6]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMyNTdhMmQ1YWE0MTQ1YjI4ZjFlMmViN2JjYzcwMTY5"><strong>[Deepsea Luminescent Shark – Level 7]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMxOTU5MWVkYWMzODQzODU4MjEzMjY0ZDNlMDZhNzFi"><strong>[Deepsea Green Shark – Level 7]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMyMWQ5YjFhNjhjYjQwN2NhNDM2NzM1OWEzN2NjMDg3"><strong>[Deepsea Putrid Shark – Level 10]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNhNmI2MTJlYWU3ZTRkNTc5Y2JmODI5YjA5MzUxZTMz">This may be the most sharks I’ve ever seen in my life… actually, this is absolutely the most sharks I’ve ever seen in my life. And there are at least three dozen of them swimming around this place. Each with levels higher than the monsters in the last cavern.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmUyN2UzMGQxNzQ0N2M5ZDFlNjZjNzgyZWVkZmQ3">Although there are also monsters aside from the sharks here. But most of them are lower level than the sharks by at least a few levels. And none of them even get close to that one shark in the cavern that’s bigger and higher level than the others.</p>
<p class="cnNiYWI3MmI2NDA1ODRjNmZhZmQ1MTYyYTBkN2IwZDZk">The putrid shark.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzA2M2EzN2I0OTQ4MmU5N2ExMTc2ZGJiNGU2YmQw">There’s only one of them in the cavern and it’s clearly the leader of the sharks.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTE3NzNjYzRkZjQ4Y2I5ZjMxOGIwMjczYTIxNDlk">At the same time though, that shark is… disgusting to look at. The thing honestly looks like a zombie in some ways. With flesh hanging off of its body and a putrid scent akin to rot coming from it.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzQzYzQzNDcwNjQ3NDM5MDljNTg1MzJkMGQ3NTdj">Thankfully I’m underwater so the scent is very dull.</p>
<p class="cnNjMjlmNjI2Mzg4YjRjZDViODIyOWExY2E0YzVlNWFm">Or at least I think that’s how it works. Considering that most people can’t even smell underwater in the first place.</p>
<p class="cnM0NDE2YWQ4ODVhMTRmMzc5ZWZiYmMwN2EwMDdkYmVj">Then again, I’m on the other side of a massive cavern from it. It’s most likely just the distance dulling the smell.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWQ2Yjg0ZDRiZTQ4MzBiZTlhNjBlMTFlZGMxMjgw">Which means it’ll smell even worse the closer I get.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDQwODA0NDA0ODQxNjhiYzRiNGRjN2ZmOWQ2YTkw">I glance at the chat to see them going wild at the sight of the sharks too.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2VlNWQ0MTA4NTQ3ZjY4OTgxNTRmMDdjZjcwMGFk"><strong>[So many sharks :o]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNlMGY3NDU1ZjdiZDQxNTM4YjhjYjA1NDFjZjViZTkx"><strong>[Just how many of them are there?!]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM3MThmZjZkZjdjMjQ0MjQ4MTU4Mzk3NWUwMjhlMDcz"><strong>[Why are so many sharks of different species cohabitating like that?]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM5N2E3ZjhmZDE3NzQwNzdiNWU0NTY5MDY1NjJlYzI5"><strong>[Probably afraid of the rotting one.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNhYmM0Zjc0MjljYTQ0ZjlhNmQ1ZmFkMGQ1YTRlOGVl"><strong>[that rotting shark looks gross]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNkYzFmYjQ4YWQ0ZTQ4NGRiZjQzNzc1MDcyNTJiYzRk"><strong>[This is why I wish these broadcasts had censorship for gross monsters just like their censorship of the Pioneers…]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM5ODRiMzlmYjM2OTQ5OTc5MjIzNmY3ZDMxYmY3MzEy"><strong>[groooooosssss]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM2NTJjYTYwMjBmODQ4ZTNiNzQwZWI4NTNhNDdjOTkw">Yeah, that’s to be expected. Not that far from my own reaction.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjY3ZWQ1MDZkMDQyNDc5MmNmZmNmOGNkNGI0YjZh">Putting the smell aside for the moment, I look around the cavern for an exit. Which I find rather quickly as there is a massive tunnel on the other side of the sharks.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjAxYTM5YTE4ZjQ1MWY5MTBjNTJiZTU4NzMyOGE4">Most of the higher level sharks are all in a single little section of the cavern with a bunch of ruined structures around them and the large tunnel right beyond them. So I don’t have much of a choice when it comes to fighting them or not.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjVjZWNkNGI5NDQ4YmU4OTFmZWFkYThkOTQwOTdm">I have to fight them to get past.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWJiN2FmMThkNjRlZTlhN2Y5NmU4MGNjNjRjOGJk">That said, a lot of the lower level sharks are spread out through the large cavern. Far enough away that I might be able to take them on one at a time. Or at least a few at a time. Getting me some levels in the process.</p>
<p class="cnMxMWE4ZTE0ZjU0NzRhMjNiYjNhM2U0ZmE2MjA4OGE1">All I need is to reach level ten. The level at which I will be getting my second skill. Then I will feel a lot more confident taking on the putrid shark.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzI3N2M2NDI3OTQ3NTQ4NjBiMzEyZWNlYjdlMzdm">And after dealing with the other sharks and monsters in this cavern I should be able to get my REGEN stat higher as well.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGE1MzA3YzFjMjQyZDI4N2Q4ODMxYzk5MTZhMGU4">So after a brief pause, I move into the cavern, heading straight towards the closest sharks. Which is a group of three level five sharks over half a dozen meters away from any other sharks.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTI5ZDRhNDVlNTRhY2FhNWYwMDlkOTY4ZWYwYTY2">The moment I get within a few meters of them, they turn their attention on me and begin charging.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTUzZmUyZWI4YzQxMTJhMThiZjI3ZWQxOTlhOGNh">Amongst these sharks in particular include two angler sharks and one horned shark.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2M2OWFlYWUzMjRmZGFiYzgzZGJmM2MyN2RhZDU0">With that in mind, I quickly move to the side to dodge the horned shark’s charge before stabbing my trident straight into their open side as they pass. Using my heightened strength from my ever increasing strength stat to pierce my trident straight through their side and almost out the other end. Killing the thing in a single attack.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTUwOTg4MTE0YjRiZDNiZmZkZTM3MjJhZGVhODZm">But before I can pull my trident out, the two angler sharks charge forth with their mouths wide open and their lanterns beginning to flare.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmM4Nzk5NjJlZjQwMDA4OWJjODNiNjNhYjJkMTcy">So instead of pulling the trident out, I maneuver the horned shark’s corpse between me and the angler sharks. Surprising them as they end up with mouthfuls of their own fellow shark.</p>
<p class="cnMwYTgzZmJlNTgyNjQ2MjA4YjcwYzExNmJhYmE5ODQ2">Then I kick the horned shark’s corpse straight at them while holding onto my trident to yank it out before rushing at the first stunned angler shark and stabbing it through the mouth to where I think its brain is probably located. Killing it as well.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWE2MjAwNzEzMTRjZWI4YmJkMzQ5ZmI5NGE1Njhj">And right as the other angler shark finally recovers, having apparently opted to swallow the chunks of the horned shark it chomped into. Only for its lantern to begin flashing with light, making me squint my eyes as I rush forwards and stab it straight through the lantern and into its eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM3YmU4MTExYmRjZjQyNmM5OTM2M2U1OWNmM2NhN2Qx">Finishing off the last shark without taking any damage in the process.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjcxYzJjZGFjMTRiZGE5NTIwZTJiZGFiM2Q3NWRj"><strong>[You have killed a level five Deepsea Horned Shark. EXP has been granted accordingly.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM4N2VkODVmMzFmMTRkMmViMzQwYTAwNGMwZjQ5OWUx"><strong>[You have killed a creature underwater. Apex Predator of the Depths has been activated, increasing your REGEN stat by one.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNlOTExZTViZWMxMDQxZjU5ZWRiYmZhZjFhZjRhNWZl"><strong>[You have killed a level five Deepsea Angler Shark. EXP has been granted accordingly.] x2</strong></p>
<p class="cnNmMjBkOTlmYjNhYjQ2ZWVhMTVkNWM1YTRiMjdiYjMw"><strong>[You have killed a creature underwater. Apex Predator of the Depths has been activated, increasing your REGEN stat by one.] x2</strong></p>
<p class="cnNiNzIzMzY3Y2I4NDRhOWJiYTNhZmIyZjNhMTA2N2Fm">I think I’m getting used to this underwater combat thing. And this trident.</p>
<p class="cnNlODYwODE0OWYwZDRkMjhhOTU4NDkzODRmZjU5ZDc5">A faint smile flashes across my face until I turn my attention to a couple other nearby sharks that were attracted by the angler shark’s flash of light.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjMxMjUyOWU0MTRiZTlhNjVjNzZmMjQ3MzUxMjJm">Let’s see how many I can hunt before the day’s out.</p>
