<p class="cnNhN2VhMmQxYTI2MzQ0MjU5YTRlNWFmNzVlNGI2YWYx" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aqua</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNlMGIxMWNhZWJhNzRkZDliNTI4OGUzOTZlMTBhOWVh">The quiz show continues for the full two hours, leaving me feeling drained by the end of it and all blushed out. So when I return to my body back in Oceana, I immediately move off to leave the city and head straight for the castle broken dungeon. Where I begin to hunt every single monster I find.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjhjMjJkZGQyNTRjZWM4ZTAxN2NhNDRkNTAzNTEz">Just traveling all the way through every bit of the castle I can reach in my time here to vent my frustration and embarrassment – mostly embarrassment – on the monsters living in it. Including the new monsters that arrived in the areas I cleared out yesterday.</p>
<p class="cnMyODkwMzA4MmU4MTRiOTdiMTUwYzg2MmRiYjllZTc4">And, of course, I make sure to stuff all them in my storage ring after killing them.</p>
<p class="cnMzMWI4Mjk0Yjc1YjQ1ZWNhNjcyNDBhNmMwY2IxZTE1">Unsurprisingly, it’s getting easier and easier to slaughter monsters in here as I level up. So I spend several hours straight slaughtering the monsters until I finally remember the appointment.</p>
<p class="cnMyMWQ2OWZiZmFlODQzYzJiYzIzZTQ4ZGNkZTVkMTk5">Without hesitation, I rush straight over to the front of the castle where I meet the tour guide along with twelve other people.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGEwMjk3NGFjMzQxYzliMmExYTBmNDc3ZDRlZTFi">That’s too many names to remember.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWMyYmM1YzhlZjRkNWRiZTUyYjJhN2NjMGY0Mjlh">I grimace at that thought as I approach.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTljODZiOTI2MjQxNjM5MDJhMmQyNmYyYjZiYjBm">Of the people there aside from the tour guide, five of them have black hair, four of them have very dark brown hair, two of them have light brown hair, and just a single one has blond hair. Clearly showing how hair colors evolved when people live in the ocean.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2YyY2FlOTk2MTRlZGY4MTNjNjZmYWEzNTQwN2Ni">Darker colors. Lots of darker colors.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjNiMTc5MWQwZTQ0ZjJiMzFlN2I5OTdlYjg2NTkx">And amongst the twelve people, four are women and eight are men. With at least three quarters of them being relatively attractive based on society’s norms.</p>
<p class="cnM4NWIxY2IxNDdkYjRlM2U4MjY0MWE1NWI1NGY1Mzgw">Oh, and they all have dark eyes too. Even the ones who had lighter colored hair have dark eye colors.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2VkYWMxNjNkMzQzMWNiZTczYjI0ODUxNGZjNjg1">Very little sunlight in the depths of the ocean after all.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDU2ZmUyYzA3MDQwYzQ4ZWQ5ZGY0MjNjNGM0MDYw">Anyway, when I get within sight of some of them and they identify me, they look rather surprised. Enough that they hurriedly say something to the tour guide that I only barely catch by shapeshifting my hearing to that of an orca’s.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDcwYTliMDYzNzQxNjc4NDY0ZGUwMDdmMWQxZmZh">“How is she level 37 already?! Wasn’t she just level 29 a couple days ago?!” “How’d she level up so quickly?!” “What’s going on?! Did you lie about her level?!”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGY0MjA4OTAwODQ4MGM5YWQ5Mzg5YjdkZWEyZTUy">Ah. That’s why they’re freaking out.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzVmMmY3MjFhMTRmNmM5YzViZWQzOTdiMDUwMWE5">I’m guessing the tour guide must have told them what my level was when he went to meet with them after that first time we split up.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjY1ZDkyNWFiNjQyZWE4NjQ3YmVhNDVhNDAyZTk4">When I arrive, I find the tour guide staring blankly at me like I’m some monster. And after a few seconds, he asks, “What the hell have you been hunting to level up this quickly?!”</p>
<p class="cnNiODA4Y2I5ZTdjYjQ4YThhOWI1NDg1NTdhODJkMGI1">I blink before shrugging and answering, “Monsters. I was in a bad mood after this morning and needed to vent.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjA5ODY1MzI1ZjRmNGFhZGVkNWE5Mzg1NzI4YTZj">The others all stare at me with the exception of the one blonde, who bursts out into laughter as she says, “I wouldn’t want to be an enemy of this lady, that’s for sure!”</p>
<p class="cnM5NzU2OThiOThkODQxZGRiOTU4YWIyZDk2YTBhZTIy">Everyone here nods their heads in agreement. And I can’t help but notice that all their levels are around level 25 or so.</p>
<p class="cnMxMmQzNDJlN2Q5YTRlYjk5YmZjNTYyN2YwMDIyZDc5">Which means they’re over ten levels below me.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2FjMzg5OGRjZTQ0MjFhODExMjgzODVlYWE5Mzg0">On that note, I glance at my own status. Since I haven’t checked it in a while.</p>

<p class="cnM3NWI0ZGMxYTJiMzQxYzI5NmY4ODU2ZDY2NzY2YjUw">I’ve made a lot of progress thanks to that broken dungeon brimming with monsters.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjhkYjliNGJhZTQzZWI4YTg0NmU3NTZlNDFkNDM0">It’s too bad you stop getting skills every five levels starting after level twenty five. Instead getting them every ten levels starting at level thirty.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTI1ZjdmYWIzMTRiZDc5MWMzZGU2OTI0YWUwNWQy">But that’s fine. I’m just three levels away from my next skill.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTY4NzZlM2JjMDQ0ZjY5ODY3NzAwMzFlNDcxMDQw">My REGEN hidden stat growth also started slowing down drastically when the monsters started losing out to me a lot in level, and my hunting became a game of numbers to level me up.</p>
<p class="cnM2OWNlN2YyNGNjYTQzZTM5Njg0NTQ2YjI3N2EyZGVl">Which is also a pity.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWRmMDI3ZjhhYzQxNjRiZWNkODIzYzdiMTM2ZDBi">Anyway, the tour guide introduces every person here one by one. Starting with the third ranked, Saphira Nyell, who also happens to be that blonde girl who laughed at me.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmVmOGM2NjE0ODQ4ZDJhOGYzYWY2MjMyYzEyZmZl">At least she will probably be easy to remember.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzNlZGY1YTMwNTRlZTFiMzcyZWYwMDdhOWQwODU2">As blonde girl. Not as her name.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWE2MGI1NjIyYzQ3YzM5OTZhNWIxNDY1NWY3NTk0">She’s the only blonde I’ve met down here after all. So it makes it easy to remember her appearance at least, even if I can’t remember her name.</p>
<p class="cnNmMGE4NGZmYjFiMjQ1Mzc5MTMwMDgzZjgxMWRiOWY4">The others kind of just go in one ear and out the other though as they don’t have as many defining characteristics about them. But I’ll probably remember them given a few days of meeting regularly.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzc4NThiZGZlNDQyZjNhMmFhYjFlNTdiMTY5ZGY1">Which I doubt will happen soon.</p>
<p class="cnMyMGQyOTQ0OGRjNDRlNGU5NjMxZTc2NmQ1MzkxMzc1">Once he finishes introducing us all, he mentions that the current plan is for the twelve to go hunting in the broken dungeon. And while he doesn’t say it directly, I’m pretty sure he’s trying to show off what they can do to me.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGIyZDkxZGJlMzRjNjJhODgxMWFkNmY4NGU0M2Iw">He mentioned something about determination earlier too. But I think I was distracted about the fact that he said the castle broken dungeon, so I didn’t pay much attention to that.</p>
<p class="cnM3YmNmZmQ0NTBjODQ0NDNhNThiYzZiZmMxNjVjYTcy">Although…</p>
<p class="cnMzZjIyMDg3N2M4NzQ3YWZhOWNlMDJlODRlNzI4ZGU3">I glance back at the castle that I just finished clearing largely out of monsters with the exception of a few major rooms that I didn’t have the time to check. Like the throne room. And the dungeons of the castle.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjZkMTk1ODg3MDQ2NjBiOWNjZWNlNTM0NWI1ZDBi">Which I suspect may have some stronger monsters in them since they’re bigger rooms.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjEwODMyODNiZjQxODE5OTY5YTQzNmNmMmU5YjNl">It’ll probably be fine though.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTdjMDI3OTBlZDRkZThhZWZmOGU5M2U2YTk0MGI2">Yeah.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmI0ZjRlOTM1ZTRiOTJhODFjYTEzOTJlY2MwMzU4">Probably.</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM5YzI5NjAzYzdjNTQyYWJhMTZiZGVmNGI0MTY1OTFh">“Where the hell are the monsters?” the tour guide mutters as we move through the castle for five entire minutes without running into even a single monster. The monsters clearly not given enough time to refill the place from outside since I just left. “This place was supposed to be filled to the brim with monsters!”</p>
<p class="cnNkYjNiNDQ5MTQxNzQ0ZDE4YjZhZmI4ODJjODEyZmIy">I trail along behind their rather tense yet awkward looking group, just trying to not be noticed right now.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjA3MTFhMWZkNDQ4OGM5NDZjYWFjNDk4YzdhMjQ3">This is totally not my fault.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTkyZGNjNDk5ZTRmMzA4Zjc1NTk0ZTViN2YxYzNi"><strong>[This is hilarious.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNlNzY5NTk4MWJhNTRiNjNiNzdmMTExNGE4MDQzZGM1"><strong>[Just casually trying to show off to the First Ranker by killing monsters in a broken dungeon, only to find the broken dungeon already cleared out. By the First Ranker.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMwMDRlMjg3ZDQzNjRjZmU5ZWNkYTUzNGQ4MjE4Y2Q2"><strong>[There are so many comedy gold clips from Aqua’s broadcast lmaoooo]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNmYTlkMDI1YmVjMTRjYzc4MWMyY2IwMTYwZDdiZGY1">No, this isn’t my fault at all. I wasn’t the one who chose this place after all.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDQzM2QzMjZmZjQxMzdiYThiN2E4YjI4ODc3Mjg4">If it’s anyone’s fault, it’s most definitely the tour guide’s for not knowing where he’s touring.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzE4YzE2NzNjYzQ1ZGY5ODU5ODI1MTE1Y2VhNmQy">After ten more minutes pass with only a couple monsters being found, the group begins to deflate almost entirely. With the tour guide looking like he’s having some internal crisis.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDEwNjZhMDFmYzQxNDBhNTc3YmIzMjg5MmViMjRj">Which is becoming more and more common these days from what I’ve seen.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTNmNzBjYWM5ZjRmZmM4OTM2OWYwYjA1OTRkNTYx">I wonder if he’s gonna be okay?</p>
<p class="cnNhYzM1NzQzYzk3YTQ1OGNhMmUyMDMxNjgxNmFkOWQx">After the twenty minute mark though, we find something. The corpse of a large shark monster I forgot to store in my storage ring.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTU3NjY1OTgyNDQ2ZDQ4ZmM1NjU4NGIxNGZkZmYx">And the tour guide seems to recognize the wound on the shark’s face as he slowly turns to face me.</p>
<p class="cnNjNThjYzIzZTgwYTQ2NjNiOGY2YjA4MmMzMGY5NGJj">He’s seen my trident after all, and it’s hard not to link the shark’s corpse and my trident when the shark has three bloody holes in its face.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDk4NWM0MWI5ZDRiNThiYTVmYzczMTU1ZmIyNjIz">Then there’s the fact that this castle is empty instead of full of corpses.</p>
<p class="cnMwMGQ0YjU2M2M4ZTQ2YjhhNDEwNmVkM2Q4NDE0NmE0">I awkwardly turn away from him, pretty much confirming his suspicions.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmU2NDA0MmFiYTQzMjQ5YWM3NDAxNGM2MTIyODYy">“Aqua,” he slowly says. “Please tell me you didn’t clear this place already.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDE3MTIxMTdjODQ1ODY4Yjk5ZGQzNmJhYTBhOTE1">Without looking him in the eye, I answer, “I didn’t clear this place already.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NzM2NTJjODBkZTQyOGI5M2RmMTBhYTE1N2U0NTM5">The blonde girl laughs at that.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTg3M2UzZmVkYTQ3ZmQ5NzA0N2I3ZDNjOWIxNjlj">“I’m serious, Aqua,” the tour guide says while rubbing his temples.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODNlNTM2OTcwODQ4ZDViYWQ0NDQ4YThiN2YxZTEz">I finally meet his gaze and nod my head once as I state, “I did not clear this place already.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMjNiYWFkNmZjMzQ2MjY5NTEzMGJlNWVlYjNmNWU5">Now he just narrows his eyes at me.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmQ0M2UxYTQ3YTQyZWE5MzZiOGM2NmViZjYyYzRi">“I’m serious too,” I state with another firm nod as I cross my arms. “There are still a couple places with monsters in them that I haven’t gotten to yet. So I didn’t clear it.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGNiNDNhNjdlNDQ1MjU5OGZlY2NjNGE2Njc2NDNm">The blonde girl bursts out into laughter, and even the others start to chuckle.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWUwNDQwNjY2MjRiZTQ5MmQ3NzYwZDkyZWNlYzEz">The tour guide lets out a sigh and closes his eyes while rubbing his temples.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTE4YzAwNjBjYTQ1OTI4MmIwZThmMGMyYzk0MWI5">“I’m starting to like this girl,” one of the guys says while covering his mouth and laughing. And a couple others nod their heads in agreement.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTQ0NDg2ZmU4ODRjODlhZDlhMDIzOWI3YmQ4NzJm">“She’s hilarious,” one of the girls other than the blonde girl adds while laughing herself.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjA0OTc3NmEzZjQ3YzdhM2EwMmQyODRlNzI0NmI3">Even the chat is laughing at the situation.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTA1ZDZlNWQ2NTQ1NTNiZjZiYTU0YTBlZWQzYzQ1">I awkwardly look away.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWQ3ODdmMjUzMTQyNzhiNGUyOWFkZjc2YjI0NWVm">At least I have another good haul today.</p>
