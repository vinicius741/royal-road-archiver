<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnMzODEwOTRkNTViYTQ1NDE4YjBhMDI3ODdjZjUzODMy" style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Alliance Pioneer Central Stadium</span><br/><em>Not long ago</em></strong></p>
<p class="cnMxNDMyZGJkZDk1OTQ4M2U4ZTBmNGI1YTAyNWIxMmM4">“Ooooh, that’s too bad! It looks like he failed another attempt at the Great Drex!” Isaac Caliorga, the host of the main Pioneer stadium of the Alliance, says, his voice echoing his pity out to the billions of people in attendance. Whether those watching online or in person. “But he can try again at least twice more before the dungeon near it breaks, right? I’m sure that’s what he’s thinking at least.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWZjYWVkZjE1MjRlZDNhNTkzODVmMWMyNDBhODIw">On a large screen high above the arena of the stadium, a single man wearing a set of high level equipment given to him through Sponsorships over his many years on the planet known as Fiorga can be seen walking back through a large forest in the direction of his home. But neither Isaac nor the viewers feel any pity for the Pioneer for this is his fifth time walking back after losing to this particular boss.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjlmNzNjMzkyZDRiZmI5ZjhkZWE5Yzk2OGVkODE4">Another screen appears next to the main screen with the image of a massive monster reminiscent of the prehistoric animal called a tyrannosaurus rex, except with the monster being several times larger than a normal one should’ve been. On top of that the creature has green rings on its sides and a green liquid leaking out from its fangs and claws, with only a few wounds from the battle.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzg4YmQ3YTg1OTRlZWQ4OTYxYjcxMDVmZjE5MmY2">Lastly, an identification tag can be seen above the creature’s head.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWJlZjlhYmFkZTQ3ZTFhYjI4ZDljNzVhYjZmZWYx"><strong>[Poisaurus Drex Delvi – Level 221]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM2MjhjZTc2OGMwYjRjNDFhMDVmYzAzNzJhOGM5MzRi">“This poor guy has just been going at the thing over and over again, now hasn’t he?” Isaac says while shaking his head and clicking his tongue.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmQyZDg2MTYzMDQwNTA5N2ZmMjMxNTc0NjgwNmY0">The host has bright green eyes and hair to match, and is one of the most well-known faces across the entire Alliance simply due to his hosting this one show in this stadium. Yet he almost never makes any appearances on variety shows or anywhere else in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGQxN2FmNzU4NjQ1NzQ5MTkwZjE2OGI0NzkwODhm">All because he himself used to be a Pioneer. And he wants to continue sticking with solely Pioneer related activities even after leaving his world behind him.</p>
<p class="cnM3N2FlZDNkNjIzNTQ5MzhhZDA4MjQ3YzE2NTRjM2Rl">Isaac opens his mouth to speak again, only to pause as something flashes across the lens that appears in front of his eye from a device on his head. Then a wide grin stretches across his face, and he spreads both his arms to his sides while the screen behind him goes black.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGNiMjNhMDBmZDRkZGRiMThlYzEzNDI0YWZmZWZk">“Do you all want to see something new?! Something I have never shown before in this stadium?!” Isaac shouts, his voice echoing across the entire stadium along with billions of devices across the Alliance. And when the people in the stadium shout that they do, he shouts back, “Oh really?! I can’t hear you!!!!”</p>
<p class="cnM1MWExMDU4ZGRkOTQyMjhhN2Y2ZGQwMWMyM2UwOGI5">Everyone in the stadium shouts even louder this time. Finally making him spin around before motioning towards the screen with one hand and snapping his fingers, making the screen change to show a large shark suddenly firing off a beam of highly pressurized water straight at a beautiful woman of around twenty years of age.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTBhZTBlNzEyZDRkMzM4MDczZTM4ZTUxNGZlNDNk">“I’m sure many of you have already seen this particular woman before across the internet, and maybe even some TV shows from lower Class worlds,” Isaac says as shouts cheering for Aqua appear even though the woman on screen is clearly struggling. “So let’s give it up for her! The one behind the current Bloodline frenzy as everyone tries their best to figure out what her Bloodline is! The one! The onlyyyy!!!” He pauses as the camera view moves closer to Aqua and the shark stops firing the beam of water. Following which she breaks out of the wall and suddenly makes four portals appear around her as several tentacles emerge from her back. Each with mouths filled with razor sharp teeth at the ends of them. And amidst all this, she turns a cold gaze on the shark while her eyes begin to go dark, with the white of her eyes being replaced with a pitch black color as her pupils and iris merge into glowing deep blue eyes in the middle of the black. “AQUAAAA FALLEEEEEEEEN!!!!!”</p>
<p class="cnM4YzJlYjdjOGY2NDQ2NWJhMThhYTFjOTU5NGMxNzVi">And right when the audience begins to roar out their applause, the cold voice of that very woman echoes out over them, with her glowing eyes sending shivers down the spines of some of the viewers amidst the suspiciously dark water around her.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDA1ZjM0Nzk1YzRkNmY4YzMxZWU1NDUyZmEyZjQx">“Playtime’s over.”</p>
<p class="cnMwM2NiZTJmOWZjODQ5NjdiYzViZGQ5MWQ0MTk3ZjY5">The audience roars even louder as Isaac smirks, feeling very happy with this perfect setup.</p><span class="cmQ4ODQ4NTQzZDllNDQ3ZGU4MmMzODdjODgzODQwOGNh"><br/>The tale has been stolen; if detected on Amazon, report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNiNzdlYzVkMDc4MDRlNDQ5M2ZlMThjMTBjNjQ3MDdi">And amidst the roaring audience’s cheers, Aqua rushes straight at the shark while the orcas all move around her to attack the shark from different angles. Only for the shark to charge again and be slowed down when it reaches the darker waters.</p>
<p class="cnNlOThiMzllMmUzYjQyYjc4NDEyNzRkYTQ2MmI1YTI4">“It seems young miss Aqua has managed to get a pretty unique skill there,” Isaac says with a nod while Aqua and the shark end up dancing around each other. With her moving back whenever the shark attacks and barely dodging, and the shark shooting a blast of water to propel itself away from her strikes. “She seems to have gotten her little hands on a skill that increases the pressure of the water around her! But that water… I know I’ve only ever seen it in one place before!”</p>
<p class="cnM4M2UyYzEwNjZjYTQxZTY4MDZmNjQxYTBiYjI3OTZi">Isaac snaps his fingers, making another screen appear. This one showing a massive spatial opening in the middle of outer space, where a seemingly endless ocean can be seen on the other side. With the dark water of the ocean being the exact same as the dark water around Aqua.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGYxNzYyZDQzMTQ4YmY5OTFkNWEyNmI4MThlNjRi">“She’s gotten her hands on a skill that increases the water pressure around her to the levels of the Abyss!” Isaac says, making the crowd split half and half.</p>
<p class="cnNhODQxNzA2NzFhNTQ4MGVhZWUyNDI1YzExOGVkODIw">Half of them go even more wild at that news while the other half go silent out of fear of the Abyss.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjA5OWRlMGFiNDRiNDBhOGM1ZmFiYzQ3ODM2ODY4">But the two combatants fighting on the screen don’t stop fighting during all this. They continue baiting the other, dodging, and attacking. With the both of them getting one attack in after another every now and then.</p>
<p class="cnM4M2EzYTFkOWRiZDQxNDQ5ZjdjNmIyN2Y3MWYyYjdh">Aqua’s tentacles slam into the shark and latch onto its side to send her flying over it and slam her fists into its other side while tearing off some of the shark’s scales in the process with the tentacles. Meanwhile the shark rams its entire body into her after she lets go, sending her flying across the cavern. Only for her to rush straight back at it.</p>
<p class="cnNhYWRlN2M2MzRlNzRiNmQ5NTBiZWIzYjAwZTZiODAw">And on top of all this, the four orcas repeatedly rush in to nip at the shark whenever it lets its guard down. Not actually doing any damage but still forcing it to pay more attention to them.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWY1OTcxYmRiZjQ5NDY5Nzc4MGY5YjljOTNiOTQ3">“Now this! This is the type of intense battles you find on Pioneer Broadcasts!!!” Isaac shouts while raising both of his arms upwards. “This is what we live for!”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzljYzc2OGFlYTQwMzZhZGQ1YmI5ZDcxNWZmNWFj">The crowd roars alongside him, excited to see the bloodshed from both sides. Excited to see the mystery. The new creatures. The new planets. And everything they have in store for them.</p>
<p class="cnMzODVmZGJkMGVkZTRlMTJhNDVlZjBjOTRiYjg1MjY3">Then it all comes crashing down when Aqua finally makes a mistake, letting the shark rush in and bite her straight on her arm. Its teeth digging right through her armor and digging into her flesh as she lets out a scream of pain.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTZlM2VhNTIwNTQwNDhiZDdhZWZmYjFkNzUxN2Jm">“Oh no! It looks like the shark may actually win this!” Isaac shouts, his voice filled with both intrigue and only a trace amount of worry. “Will this be the end of the Bloodliner Pioneer Aqua Fallen?!”</p>
<p class="cnNmNzNiNzBiZjUxNDRhMjI5MzY0Mzk3MGY0OGZjOTU2">The shark begins to swing its head from side to side, slowly tearing away at her arm as the woman screams in pain.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzIzNmY3ZTNlNjQ3NmY4MmEwZmVjNTEyMmVhNGMx">But then for some reason a smile spreads across her face.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzRmNGExZGZhNzQwOGY4Njc4OTI3NTNjYTRjYTc2">“Wait, does she-” Isaac begins, only to cut off when <em>something </em>happens inside of the shark’s mouth. Making large impressions appear on the outside of its mouth and head, swelling outwards as if something was pushing on it from the inside.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTE3N2JjMGZiMzQ2ZTdhY2U5YWZmZWY2NDE1NTgz">They don’t just stop at impressions though as the swelling continues over and over again as Aqua begins panting in exhaustion, clearly beginning to run low on mana and stamina. And large tentacles appear outside of the shark trying to pry open its mouth without any success.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjIxMmY2MjQ2ZjQ0OWY5YTFlYTg2OGMzYWE3ZGQ0">But she’s not alone in her exhaustion as the shark is slowing down in its attempt to tear off her arm. Slowly shaking its head less and less with every impression left in its mouth.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWUyZTJmZjIzNzQyMjQ4Y2RmZjU4Y2NjNDI5MjMy">All the way until Aqua grits her teeth and grabs onto her right shoulder with her left as if bracing herself.</p>
<p class="cnMxODEzMTA2NWM2ZjQwZjlhZDhkOTc2M2Q3ZDQ2MGYw">Then her storage ring in her left hand flashes and the shark’s jaw is suddenly violently jerked backwards before opening. Revealing a trident that appears out of nowhere inside of its mouth.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDIwMGRhMDBhMTRkZDA5ZmYzODM2YWZiYjI5ZTIz">A trident sticking straight through what appears to Isaac and the audience to be a completely shredded mouth. As if someone was throwing blades around inside of the thing.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjc5N2E3MTFlYjRlYmM4MzhkYzRiZTk0MzY4NWVk">But at the same time, when its jaw is violently ripped open sideways instead of vertically, it finishes ripping off Aqua’s arm entirely from the upper bicep. Making her scream out loud in pain even as the glow from the shark’s eyes finally begins to fade.</p>
<p class="cnMwNmFiOTYyOWZmODQwNDA5OTRmMjc2YjE1NDdhNzVj">Silence fills the audience for a few seconds before Isaac shouts, “And there you have it! Aqua has finally defeated her longtime rival, the ripper shark! And she has done it in an incredible manner, tearing the shark apart with blades formed from the highly pressurized water around herself <em>inside of the shark’s mouth</em> before summoning her own weapon to her hand still inside its mouth to finish it off!”</p>
<p class="cnNhYjQxMTVjNDY2NDQxMjY4NDViNGM0YzdhMjhiNDY3">The audience goes absolutely wild as Aqua clenches her shoulder with pain clearly visible on her face. And no one is surprised by this since she just lost her arm.</p>
<p class="cnM2NmM5YzJhZGY1YzQ4MmU5NjQ3NmMxMTVkN2U0ZjRm">“It looks like Aqua will be searching for a prosthetic soon,” Isaac comments amidst the roaring audience, making some of the people watching laugh while others begin making calls to various prosthetics companies about potential sponsorships.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDE0OWU1NGY0OTQwMDU4YWVmMTkxNWI1MTIxOGRj">After all, a Pioneer wearing a prosthetic company’s prosthetic limb is the very definition of promotion.</p>
<p class="cnNlODYxZGJhOGI5ZDQ0ZDA5MWQ2OThhNzlmNjUzYTVj">Everyone watches as Aqua slowly swims through the cavern – one filled to the brim with water thanks to her orca summoning skill – before entering her small home and dismissing the orcas. Making the water level return to normal. Then she summons some bandages from her storage ring and begins bandaging up her shoulder as the broadcast finally comes to a close.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTkwNDRjNzE3NDRkNTA4YWQxZDk0MWI3ZTA4ODE2">Isaac finds himself smiling as he watches her.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmViM2NkNzA1NDRlMGU5MDVkMGM3NjU2NTFhZDlj"><em>I think I may have found a winner. One who can survive.</em></p>
