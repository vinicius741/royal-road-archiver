<p class="cnNmMDhhNDQzMjEyNTQ1M2NhMDQzMTlmZWU4ZGI4YzYw"><strong>[Congratulations! You have now reached level 15! Your total free points have increased by two, and your mana stat has increased by ten. Allocate the free points whenever you please. Additionally, you have now unlocked your third skill.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNjYWJmNmFjMTAzNDQ2OThhNWE5NWQ2ZGI5N2IzNjQz">On the flipside, killing these orcs is incredibly easy when they’re in the water. So that’s very nice.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjZiMzQ2NjU1ZTRiMWY4OTU2NmIzN2VkMzZiMGNl">They’re literally completely helpless in the water.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzMxMzk1NzdmMzQwMjhhNjM5NTFkY2MxZGZjZTNh">Anyway, I go ahead and open my status again before putting off allocating the free points for now to check what my new skill is.</p>

<p class="cnMwMGQ4YjdjNDg5OTQ2ZTRiMDlmMDNiY2JiM2RhMGE2" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>[Cost: Hydrokinetic Wrath costs a total of three mana for every base use of the skill.

Report sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmOTUzOTI3MDQ4YTQ2YzA4OWYxYmZhYzQwOGFmNmEw">I stare blankly at the new skill for a few seconds before feeling a grin spread across my face.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGZkMTdhODFhODQ3YzZiOWExNDZhZjc4NjU4YmUy">This isn’t really a domain skill, but it’ll have the same effect for a short period of time.</p>
<p class="cnMwNzhjMGE1YjhkMjRkOTM4YjJiMzBhMGYzM2Y3YjY1">As for the deepsea orcas the skill summons? It’s always nice to have help in a fight.</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2IyZTUwMzJiMDQ4NDc5YmEzM2M4ZDlhODUwNGJl">So at the end of the day, this skill will be incredibly useful. Even with its cooldown and enormous mana cost.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzI3NjBiM2U0NzRmMmQ5MGUyYjM3N2JiYmRiNGNm">I highly doubt the boss of this dungeon is going to have much water near him. Which will make this skill a must-have to fight whatever the boss is.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGRlYjZjNTY0MjQ5NTJhNjZmMGM0NWYwZDk2Mzk0">After all, the boss should be around level twenty. And trying to fight a level twenty boss outside of the water is just stupid.</p>
<p class="cnNhY2JkY2Y0MTc4NzQ2MzI5MTFiYzY2OTZhMDU2ZGI0">I kill a couple monsters I missed as I head back to my little safe place I found in the ruins. Then I begin looking through my mail again to see if there’s anything new. Or anything interesting that’s new that is.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWNkMDRkNmI2MTQ2ZTg4ODE4MmE3YjJlYWI4YjA3">Nothing really stands out though. Which is a little disappointing.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDdhZGQyZDAyYzRhYTk5OWYyM2Q5YTBkMWQwYTBj">On another note, I do have to wonder why so many of the fan mail are starting to call me cute and adorable. Because I don’t remember doing anything cute or adorable.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2U5ZWQwNmNiZTQ3MGE5NWM2Y2RmODYwMjcyYmMx">It’s too bad I can’t look at any forums or watch TV to know what’s going on.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTFiNDdlN2NmNjQzZGY5MGQ5MmNjMGM0YTNmYThl">All I have access to is the mail from the Broadcast System.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzlhM2U5NmZhNDQ5ZGI4M2Y4MjM0NjZiZjM3OTll">After searching through my mail for a little while longer – mail that’s reached the six digits in number – I close out of the menu and lie back down. Only briefly glancing at the broadcast symbol on the corner of my vision to find it currently off.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTdkYzcwYjVlYzQzNmJiY2IyYWI1ODM1MDQyMzhk">Then I slowly close my eyes and fall asleep again.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzNkYWRkNGJlMDQ4YzNhODFhMzVlMjFiMDE5ZDA4">Marking the end of day eight.</p>

<p class="cnMyNDlkYWViYmViZTQwMzBhMDkwODg2MjIyNTBhNzNk" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Star Pioneer Agency</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNiY2U3YjlkZjJiZjQ4Y2M4NWM2ZDIzNTljNjVhODUw">“Then we’re all in agreement?” Rhettfelt Hydrignis asks as he sits at the front of a long table with various images of the Pioneer known as Aqua Fallen scattered across the walls of the room on screens.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzcyM2ExYmMxNzQ2MDI5ZTg5MjAxODExMDRkZDVm">No one within the room speaks up. Everyone around the table just silently watches the CEO of the greatest Pioneer agency in the entire Alliance as he waits for any discontent with the decision.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTAyZmU5NDk4ZDQ3Njg5YzBjMzVhZGJlYzg4YjNm">But when no one speaks up, he eventually turns around to look at the images around the wall while declaring, “Then it’s settled. Star Pioneer Agency will officially reach out to the Pioneer Bloodliner known as Aqua Fallen to sign her with our company.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjg4N2RhMDI1NDQ2NzM4MzIxOGE4NGRhZTQzZGVl">Silence fills the room with the only noises being those from the many screens playing in the room.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2ZlMjJkMTE1MjRlMGNhM2UyMDUyNTA5YTE2ODdl">Rhettfelt has been feeling strange ever since the moment he first laid eyes on the new Bloodliner. But whether that’s because of his own Bloodline or because of the clear star potential he can sense in her, he isn’t sure.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTRkYTY0MzYzZTRkZTJhZGU3MmY3NjE4OTA4NDlh">Either way, there’s no way he is willing to let her slip through his grasp.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzAwOTljYWQ1NzQxMTdiZTVhNzliNDk0ZjFhMjdk">A Pioneer of her potential needs to be represented by the greatest agency of the Alliance. There’s no other way around it.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTExODYwYTA1NjQ0YjVhMWFhZmY1ODIzNDI0ZmE4">And more importantly, the Bloodline families would never allow a Bloodliner to be represented by an agency that is not being led by a Bloodliner. Because regular agencies can’t be trusted to look after a Bloodliner.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTA0MGY2ZWQwNDQ3MmU5YjgyZjI4N2U5MmRlMWY2">Bloodliners are special after all. They’re treasures to the Alliance.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmVmZWI3NmU2ZDQxMjg5MTY4Nzg1OWEzYjc2Nzlj">Anything that can increase the power of the Alliance is a treasure. And Bloodliners are powerful, with the awakened blood and skills of the Ancient Monsters their blood originates from. Making it so no one at the same level is a match for them.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmZiNTZjYjAxMTQxY2ZiMjVhYmYwZmE3MzY4ZWQ5">Even greater are the higher level Bloodliners. Those who have received several skills from the Ancient Monster.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjE4N2NhZWRjNDQzMjBiZGE4ZGRiY2FkNmVlMjM5">The strongest Bloodliners are even capable of transforming into the Ancient Monster whose blood they received and back.</p>
<p class="cnMxZGNjMzdmMzdlYzQzMDNhZWUyYWE3MjI1NzEwMjlk">And Rhettfelt is one of those powerful Bloodliners. A Bloodliner capable of transforming into a hydra and back.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjYxZjZkN2VlNjQ3MTI4ZTQ1NGIwYmJjNGM4YWFj">But the thing Rhettfelt and the other Bloodliners hate the most are when other people try to take advantage of them.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTg4MmEzNzlmNDRiYWU5ZTNlZWI4YjgyN2Y5Yjlm">Someone using a Bloodliner for their own purposes is acceptable so long as the Bloodliner is repaid in full. But someone trying to take advantage of an ignorant Bloodliner is enough to bring all the Bloodliners of the Alliance down on them.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjA0YzUzZDM1NTQzYmU4OGJhOTk1OTQ1Y2EwNmNj">That’s why even the Grand Chancellor, the current Administrator of the System and highest level person within it, has to listen to and pay the Bloodliner families for their services.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2I2Y2I4YWRkOTQ4ZDRiNDNjNjk4MzJmMzY5ZTc0">On a personal level, Rhettfelt even respects the Grand Chancellor in a way. Because of the man’s brilliance.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzg0N2I1MGM5YjRjNTVhYzM1OTFjODc2MjMzZDU0">He’s incredibly intelligent and knows who he can threaten and who he can’t.</p>
<p class="cnM3OGJhNDc3NWM0ZTQyZmM4NDEwN2QzZDhhZjA2NDVi">Even the mere creation of a Pioneer Bloodliner can be considered paying them in full since they wouldn’t have ever known they had a Bloodline if they weren’t made a Pioneer by the System. Which is a fair trade in Rhettfelt’s eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmY1MzllYmU1ODRmYWRhZTA0MzI0MTY1NDI3MTk1">Risk and reward.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGQzNDY2Y2Q3ODQ0YmM4M2Q3MDVmNzI1ODkxOTIy">Still. That feeling Rhettfelt gets when he looks at Aqua continues to bug him the longer he watches her. Meanwhile the rest of the people in the meeting room begin to clear out, leaving him alone.</p>
<p class="cnNjMWIwNDE3MDcxNzRhYjE4ZWMyNGI4YzE4Y2RmODI0">The known details about the girl’s bloodline are similarities to two different types of creature.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTJhNTFlYTZjMzQyNDg4NTM1OWJiNDEzMWJhMTgx">The Abyssal Orca Bloodline, and the Kraken Bloodline. However nothing has been confirmed as of yet, and the Orcayne family still won’t say a word about the matter.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2VkYTRjNDBlYzQ1OWU5NjIwMjk2ZmQyNDc3ZTcy"><em>Aesthetics of the Abyssal Orcas, narrowed iris of the Krakens, tentacles of a strangely colored Kraken, increased regeneration, powerful physical strength in the water, the ability to move and breathe freely underwater, and a common pressurized water control skill amongst aquatic Bloodlines…</em></p>
<p class="cnM0NWUzMGM0OGNiYTQ2MTFiYTQxNjAxMWEyZjZhYTdm">Just listing all the different things the girl has shown in one go gives Rhettfelt a headache.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGE0MDZkZmUyMzQ1MjM4ZmI2ODA0NzA1NzZhZmQy"><em>Maybe the sensation I’m feeling is because of our shared regeneration?</em></p>
<p class="cnM4ZmZlMjkwMGE2OTQ0YjNiMGY2MGIzMzNkODdhODg5">Rhettfelt frowns at that thought.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDQ1NWYwYmU3NjQwYWY5MzNjMmE3ZTgxMzMyYjc0">The two creatures in the universe with the greatest regeneration of all time.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTJjNjIzZTA3MzRjODBhYjMzYmVlNTBkNTI4YzE5">The Kraken. And the Hydra.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmIxY2MzYTI0OTQxOGJiMWUzNTUwNDg5OTYwYWNm">After considering the matter for several more minutes, Rhettfelt eventually gives up, deciding he’ll find out about it when the Bloodline Research Center figures it out.</p>
<p class="cnNmNWVhMDAxYmJkZDRiZDRiZGFjZjE4MDM2ZmRlYTRj">For now he needs to focus on getting her to sign with their company.</p>
