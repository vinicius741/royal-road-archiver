<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNhZDFhZGNkNjY3NDRhNTg4YTIzNTc3ZDhiZDhiNWZk" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aqua</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnMzZTJlODc5YjllZDQ3ZTE5ZTJlZDNjMDE4NTlkYWVi">I find my jaw dropping in shock at the sight of the sponsorship in question. At all of it.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTU5ODIzNGIwMTQ0NDE4M2IzMWM0YjYwNGMxYTE0">Whether it’s the contents of the message, who the sponsorship is from, and even the item I’m being given.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmI5ZjFkNGFhNzQ3ZDY4MTNiNWYwNzFlZDExNDA0">It’s all shocking as hell.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDRlZTA1NmI1NTRiMDI5NWZlNjM5NTFkZDE0NGUy">And kind of confusing.</p>
<p class="cnNjZGZhOWUwZTg5NzQxNmM5OTEwMmRlZDM5YmM5MDU4" style="text-align: center"><em>Thank you. Take this and do with it as you will.</em></p>
<p class="cnNhOWFhNGM1YjA5ZDRhNjhiNDhiMTNlMGRjNTFiMTk1">What’s more is that, since the Sponsorship is a Special Custom Sponsorship, the message and who it’s from is publicly shown on the broadcast. So my entire chat can see who it is.</p>
<p class="cnNlY2ZlZjExOWE4ZDQ5ZjQ4ZTg2MjUwNzIzMjYxM2Vm"><strong>[No way…]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM3MWM3NDE1MWQ4MTQwNmE4MDhmN2ZlYzQxNTM2NTgx"><strong>[huh?]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMxNjFiMjgwNmE3ODQyNzE5NDA5OWZmNGI1YzJiMWRj"><strong>[but… huh?]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMyOGZiNWUwMzc3YTQ3YjI4OWU1OWY5ZjZiYTViNjY1">I ignore all of them though as I look at the name of the sponsor.</p>
<p class="cnNlMmIyODQyYzFiZjQ5ODQ4ZjNjNDRjZWNjMTFjNmUy">Renthal St’Radah Star.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDg1YWVlODBjOTRiMTQ5YWFlNzI5NThlMTU2MWM0">The Grand Chancellor of the Alliance.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDg2NjFjOTU5MTQ3ZmM5ZjA2MGY3OWM5NDBhNDJj">Why is he sponsoring me? Is it because I’m a Bloodliner?</p>
<p class="cnMwOWU5MWYxMDMxODQxYmI4MmE4ODAzOTVkOTU1MjVh">I could theoretically see that happening. Even with how ridiculously expensive a Special Custom Sponsorship is.</p>
<p class="cnNkMjNlYjkwNDljMTQ4NTM5MmNhMzY0NjFmZTRjN2Yz">It’s four different prices on one.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGFkNDc1YjQwMTRhZTA5OWFjYjM1NDczOGY0OGY2">The first price is obviously the right to make a custom sponsorship in the first place. Sponsoring something the System allows but isn’t on its current list of sponsorships.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODE1ZGQ2N2E0MzQ5ZTg4ZDE1NmNhNDBmNDUzZDVj">The second price is the Special part, which is why it’s shown to the broadcast as well. Which usually doesn’t happen for Sponsorships.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTYxZWJmMzRjMjRmY2Q5ZjAyY2Q2MDFhYmZmMmNm">It’s generally up to the Pioneer whether they show it or not. And I’ve only shown some of the more important ones. Leaving Rhett to make note of the other ones I accepted without saying anything.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjgwZDE2MDQ0OTQ3YTBiYWY1OGYxNDBjZjAyOTdm">Then there’s the third price. Which is the regular price to sponsor someone in the first place.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTBjZjIwYjJkZTQzY2JiZGQ0N2JlNWQ1OTAxNGVi">And finally, the price of whatever item he is giving me as the sponsorship.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmQ0OWE5YzMxYjRlOTdhYWQzNjlkMmVlNmQ3YWFl">Yet the thing he gave me…</p>
<p class="cnMwMjE5N2JkMWEzMjRhMGY4ODNiMjkzYzU1NzgzZjU3">Even I feel slightly heavy accepting this.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTYyNzliY2M1YzQ3ZTM4MGM5NDZmMDFlM2VkZjBh">But the problem is that you can’t even reject these Sponsorships even if you for some reason want to. So it doesn’t matter how heavy of a sponsorship it is.</p>
<p class="cnNmZmU2YTVmNDI0MjQzZDhiMzA2YjBiYjVlNzEzMzhl">Then again, he did say thank you and that there are no requirements.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzlmYWMyMjQ2YzQyN2ViOWFkMjJhMTZkYWZjODEw">I blink at that.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDY5YjNkZjRjYzRmMzk4MGJhOTVmODVlM2VmNWNm">Actually, why is he thanking me?</p>
<p class="cnM4MTQ3OTVkZjUzMzQ4ZjdiMjIwNTFjYTkxMDUxNTFh">Did I do something for him without realizing it?</p>
<p class="cnM1MDNiYTNkZjM4ODRiYzk4MTFhZjhmZTkyMDYzNjU2">I frown at that thought before shaking my head and focusing on the screen in front of me as the item in question from the Sponsorship comes out. With said item being in the form of a large cube.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDQ0YTMyNDFlYTRjMmM5YjI4Nzk1NTc2Y2E3Mjgz">He really gave me one…</p>
<p class="cnM1MTA4N2NjOTVmMTRiMWNhYjkyY2Q5OWExOGY3Mzhj">I reach out to grab the large cube.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjBkYWI5OTViZDRmZWViMDZkYjczODE4ZGQ3MDlm">The thing is black in color with glowing blue indented lines running through it. And the thing itself is emanating an immense amount of mana. So much that I almost instinctively put it into my storage ring.</p><span class="cjdkYTdkZTBjYjQ4NzQwMTVhYzkyZjRkMmZkNjk0YzAx"><br/>Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNmMmI0YmQ3MGM1MzQ1Njk5NDE3Y2U1YWE5N2JhZjBm">Because it’ll probably attract attention out in the open like this.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2ZmZDA4ZmIwNjQzZWFiNzM5M2IzYzhhMzBhZDlm">I still can’t believe he actually gave me one of these…</p>
<p class="cnM5NjQzMzQ0NDYxYzQ4M2U5MGQ4ODgwNDY1YjlhMWU3">They’re worth an absolute fortune after all.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTAzZGY1ZGRlYzQ5YjY5ZjliZGU4NDQ5MDcwZGQ5">This particular item is one of the few things that can get people special cores after all. Cores that, when crushed, grant the one breaking it a random hidden stat.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjgzZDQwZTliMjQ5NGFhNGIyNTJmOWJkNmJhNDI0">But it doesn’t just give the user the special core.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzYzMDZlNTczYzRjZWY5YWVjMWJlZTMzNDVlMjFl">Nope.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjdiMWFjNjQwYzQxYWM5MzUwNmJiY2U2NzZkZDVk">It spawns a dungeon that is automatically set to be above the user’s level. And at the core of that dungeon is a random special core.</p>
<p class="cnNmM2VjMmM0NTU1MTQ1NmM4ZDQ5ODQ5YTczZjA1YzAz">Which you have to defeat the boss to obtain.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjk3ZTE3YjlmNDRhM2RhOGQyOGUwNDRkMGM1NDVh">I glance at the chat to find them all freaking the abyss out at the sight of the special dungeon in my hand. Then I turn my attention back to the thing as I put it into my storage ring. Which is fortunately possible.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjdjODkyMTkzODQ2NWI4ZmYyNDA5OTdiNTU4OTIy">And when I do, the immense mana radiating through the area quickly begins to fade.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzg2NGIwMjcyMjQwYzQ5Y2Q1N2U1NjI1MzFmMWYw">I get the feeling this broken dungeon is going to have more monsters again tomorrow…</p>
<p class="cnM2MmY1ZGNlYjkwNTQ1ZjFiYjdiMDYzZDhlMzgyZTFl">Still, despite that I won’t be coming back here tomorrow. Because my next target is that mountain.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDlmMWU5YzRiYjQzYzJiMDZjNjljNDQ4MmJjOGY5">There should be plenty of monsters there from what I saw when the tour guide’s group were hunting there.</p>
<p class="cnM3ODI4YTUzOWI2NzQ3OTE4YmRmNDU5Y2U0ZWQwM2Yx">Actually, I still have plenty of mana remaining thanks to those two monsters killing each other. So I should actually be able to handle some more hunting.</p>
<p class="cnNjYWZmZDcwOGFiODRkYWViYTc1YWRiMWNhYWMwY2Qz">I glance at the time-stamp on the chat messages, ignoring what they’re saying. Only to find that it’s around five or so PM now. Enough time to go hunt for a few more hours before returning to the inn for the night.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTA0YWZiYzMxNTQwYjRhODg0NTIwMTU1ZjQzMWEy">Alright then. Plan made, time to execute it.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTk3ODM3MmEzMjQ4YTVhZjAyN2NjZjJiZDlkMDI4">I nod my head at that thought before heading in the direction of the floating mountain in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p class="cnMzNmI4OWYxYjRjZDQ2YjViYTc0OTQ0MjZiY2QyYjdm">Which, if I’m being honest, looks even more ridiculous than the floating castle in the middle of the ocean. Just a little though.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTIxMDJiMmExNTRkZDI5NGQxM2JiMjhmMTEzNGIz">The mountain itself is probably around a kilometer in height. And it starts somewhere around the 6700 or so meter depth and goes at an angle towards the 6000 meter depth.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWNhOTEzNmM5NTQ5N2Q5MWUzZGJiM2QyYjMwZjll">Meaning it’s far larger than the castle.</p>
<p class="cnNhOWI2MTllMDQ5ZTQxZDFhNDU0NjlhYTAyMDhkYjVm">Far, <em>far </em>larger.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODA2MDFlMDExNDRkNjBiMTFmZjMxNjZhNjg5MGNl">It also runs deeper into the ocean. Which means there will be stronger monsters inside at parts of it.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzZkMjMxNDJjYjQ3ZDY5MzRiMzRlYzhlNjIzNGRj">The part I’m entering is the top of the mountain though. And it’s the same part that the others entered through before.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTU4NmY3OWUxNDQxNDNiZjc2ZTMxZjZkNmUyYTlj">The tour guide and his group only cleared a small portion of the place. Not much at all in the grand scheme of things. And the parts that they cleared were full of level twenty to level twenty-four enemies.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjJjZWM1MjNlMzQ3MGJiZWMyNmZkOGJjM2QxZjgx">Easy enemies to defeat. Ones I can defeat just by grabbing and crushing with my bare hand.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjdkN2M3YzdjNzRiNTViMDc3YWY4N2MzZThkMjU2">I yawn as I approach the same entrance they entered through. Then I proceed through the place while occasionally killing a new monster that appeared since I was last here with them.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDRjYzgzN2ExNTQ3ZDVhZTNjNmIxNzAyZmFiOTNk">Just slicing the things in half whenever they appear with my trident.</p>
<p class="cnM3MmI3NTUwYmNjNjQzYzBhZmNlOWQxZWZiODM2Y2Q2">The monsters here are different from the ones in the castle in terms of species as well. So it’s not just their level.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTU3NGJmMGYzMDQzNTA4MmFhMWM5MDdjYjJhMWQ5">This place has a lot of more ground-based underwater creatures. Like crabs, eels, starfish, and the like. Along with several cave dwelling ones and some group gathering ones.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTU0OWJjNWQ1NDQxNDU5NTczOThhMmZkMjUwOWRm">Like jellyfish and some glowing cave fish.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmYwOWUwYTgwYTRjM2RhZmZmNjRjOWNjM2YyODA1">Overall though, nothing particularly dangerous yet. Especially with their levels being so low here.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWNlYThmN2Y0ZDQxOTlhNDMwMDMxOTgyYTRkNTgw">So I continue swimming through it. Slaughtering the monsters as I go.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTk5NjhmM2Y4NTQ2M2Y4NGI2N2FkYmY0YzQ2ZmNl">Meanwhile the chat asks about when I plan on using that dungeon for the special core. To which I answer with a brief, “I’ll use it when I get my next trait at level seventy-five.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNzU1OWI2YThjYjQ5ZmViN2QyNjIyYmE5YzAzZjE4">An answer that seems to satisfy most of them. With only some of them looking rather obviously disappointed at my answer.</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2Q0MDdhZGQwNzQzNjU4M2MxYWFlNmQyZmE3OWU5">Probably wanting to see me go through the dungeon sooner.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzdlNWI1YTlmMzQ1YTE5ZWJmMzgyOGZkNThhMWNh">But I just ignore them and continue hunting monsters in the mountain tunnels.</p>
<p class="cnNhYjBkZGNmMmRkOTRiY2Y4ZDdlNzU0MGEwNGFlNjU5">There aren’t actually any monsters outside of the mountain, and the trees that used to be on top of the mountain… well, used to be is the key word there. I have no idea where they are now.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTg2NzYxZjQyZjQxMzdhOTEzOTRhMzQyOWM0YjU2">So it’s just entirely tunnels now. Tunnels full of monsters.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjgyZDYwN2YyMzQyYzlhNTEzYjY4MDhjNjZiMmU5">It kind of reminds me of my time in the caves. Except with different materials making up the walls.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDg0M2RmMjNhNzQwMjU5NGU4ODY4N2E0NzZlYjM4">Lots of dirt now mixed in with the stone and sediment.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGI0ZTRjZmIwNDQxODdhODFlNTVmOWVjYTczNWZi">Unlike the caves which were all just dense stone.</p>
<p class="cnM1NGJiZjg2NTI3NTQyYzc5MjExYjU5NmI4NTg5ZTli">Once in a while as I explore the tunnels, I end up finding some ore veins. But since this is a broken dungeon, I can’t actually mine them. Leaving them to waste.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODdiMDM1ZWU2ZTRlMDhhZTc3ZTJjOTlmNzdkN2Zh">Other than that, the trip is rather boring and without anything of note happening.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjBhYzNhYWI4NTRjYmQ4NjYxZTk0YjczODk5ODQ1">Even when I reach the part of the mountain a bit deeper that has monsters in the level thirty range. They still don’t stand a chance and I end up splitting most of them in half with my trident.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmZhYWUwMDcxNDQ5OGVhMWIzZGNkMzljN2JhYmI1">Meanwhile they don’t really give me much in terms of EXP. And they don’t give me anything in terms of REGEN stat points.</p>
<p class="cnM0MzhjZWYzNjhmODRkMGZiMDI5ZTNkNTA1N2JiNDdj">With only a couple exceptions.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzQ3ODFjYmM4OTRmOGJiYzBiOTQ4MjVhYWY1ZWEy">So after hunting for several hours, all the way to ten PM, I go ahead and look for an exit. Then after leaving the mountain, I go swim back to the Hunter’s City.</p>
<p class="cnM2NmIyZTFiZWQ2MjRhNjdiMDIyOTE3MmUzYTE2NTdm">And this time a couple of the harvesters faint when they see my haul.</p>
<p class="cnMyYWIxMmY5NGUzMTQwOTliMWM5MGQ5M2NkZTFkOTJi">I wonder why?</p>
<p class="cnMwZTEzNzU5NWE1NDRjMzBhMGQ0N2NjMWQyMTViMTU1">Well, regardless of the reason, it’s not my problem. So I go back to my room at the inn under the exasperated look Jen’s for some reason giving me.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTI3YzI5MTk2YjQwYzA5MDE1YWFiZWUyZTQ4ODNl">And after changing out of my armor, I flop back onto the bed. Feeling rather satisfied with the day as the broadcast ends.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzc0ZTY0MGQ5YjQ1MTViYWRkZmU5NTliZThmODYw">Time for some sleep, then I have a variety show in the morning.</p>
