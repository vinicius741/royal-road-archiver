<p class="cnMwMDczZDhjZjU3ZDQ1ODQ4YzBmYzEyODBkNjU3NmEz" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Within the Orcayne Manor</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM3MzJkZDdiYmJhMzRiZWE4ZmZiOGU4OGEzM2VhMjE1">Seravos quietly sips his tea as he sits within the meeting room of his manor with the other members of the Orcayne family alongside him, and a couple members of the Hydrignis family as well. All with dozens of different screens across the walls, each showing different news outlets.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGFhNDMxZjlhODQyZjQ5NjI1NTc2NGU3NWRlZTk2">“Breaking news! Aqua Fallen’s name has officially become Aqua Orcayne! It’s been revealed that she is the granddaughter of General Orcayne himself!”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDc3NDYzZDkzNTQ3ODk4OTk1ZTkyMTJiZGZkNGU0">“Bloodliner and Pioneer Aqua Fallen has turned out to be a lost child of the Orcayne family! The daughter of General Orcayne’s own daughter!”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWM3NWYwNjhmYjQ2YTg5ZDQzMmQ2ZWM0NDc3ZTc1">“Has the very first dual Bloodline Bloodliner been discovered? The granddaughter of General Orcayne shows signs of both the Kraken and Abyssal Orca Bloodlines!</p>
<p class="cnMzMjBmYzI5YTI4MTRlNTNiZWM1MTg2OGJkYjMyNjFk">Despite the dozens of new stations, along with various Pioneer News broadcasts and stadiums, all showing the news breaking out across the entire Alliance, none of the Bloodliners in the room look the least bit tense. With the sole exception of the two Hydra Bloodliners within the room.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGUxZDRjZDQ3MzQ3NjFiNjVmOGU2ZmRkZDYxYWUz">“You better take responsibility for this, Seravos,” the matriarch of the Hydra Bloodline, Flare Hydrignis, says as she glares at him with a face and appearance very similar to her son, Rhettfelt.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmMyZjcwZWVkNzRjN2ViNTlkNmM5ZjcyY2Y1NDlj">“Why are you here, Defense Minister of the Alliance?” Seravos asks without putting his tea down. “This matter has nothing to do with the Alliance or your family.”</p>
<p class="cnM3M2ZlOWI2NDczYzQ5NTI4MWQ2NTNiM2M5ZWQ2Zjk4">“As a matter of fact, it does have something to do with my family,” Flare declares while putting her hands on her hips. “My son has already signed a contract with her, so our family is managing her activities in the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NTYzYTRiZTgxYjQxOGQ4NmEzZDNkNWU4NGZmMmE3">Seravos doesn’t show any change on his face as he sips his tea again and taps his new cane. Then, after several seconds of silence with the only sound being the screens showing the news reports, he says, “This was the only way to stop them from taking her in the future.”</p>
<p class="cnNkODUwNDcxMDYxMTQ4NTZiZjFjYTVlMTIwZDFkNjVl">His words shock both Flare and Rhettfelt as it serves an indirect admission towards what many are currently suspecting.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTFlZDQxOWYyYjQ2YjA5Y2E2NTcxYmVhOTUxZjBi">Everyone knows the hatred between the Kraken and Abyssal Orca Bloodlines born from their instinctive pride and drive to be the strongest beings of the water. So the possibility of a child between the two makes both the Hydras in the room shiver at what might happen to the child.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDIxZTdkMjJlOTQ0MjNiMjUyMDYyNTZhMTVkNzQ1">There are two possibilities they can think of.</p>
<p class="cnNjOWYwMzk0MjU5ZTQ2MDRiYjQ0ZGM0ZjM2NjJiMDhk">The child could be persecuted by one or both sides, or they could be pulled in a game of tug-of-war between the two sides.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjFhNzg0N2QyZDQ5ODA5YWViMTAxOGI0Yjg2Zjkz">“They’ve already begun making moves to make sure she joins their family after her Pioneering is over,” Seravos declares without a change in his expression as the other Abyssal Orcas in the room all nod their heads in agreement. “And I will not allow my granddaughter to go to those filthy Krakens.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjllM2EyZDc1MzQ2NjdhYjFjZTU3NDg1MWJjOWIy">A tense silence fills the room after he finishes speaking.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjU0M2Q4Zjk3YTRlMDhhZThmZGQ0MzMxNWE2Nzcz">“Are you sure you should be speaking like this, Blubber?” a voice echoes through the room before a portal of water appears on the other end of the room behind the table. Following which a man with narrow eyes lacking any white in them and deep blue hair just as dark as the Abyssal Orcas but without the white streak calmly leaps through the portal over the table before landing on and then sitting on the edge of the table right in front of the general. “I mean, didn’t you go against your daughter’s last wishes before she and Orvyn were lost in the Abyss?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NDQ3NjYwMmRiZTQyZmU4MDI0ZjU3YzM0YmQ2ZDkx">The man tilts his head while staring at Seravos, making the man’s eyes burn with rage as water begins to leak out of Seravos’ pores just at the sight of the man in front of him.</p>
<p class="cnMwM2M4ZTViN2RlZjQ5MTI4MjFjMDgxNGE2OGEwMjY2">Kaelthas Azuranth, the patriarch of the Kraken Bloodline and father of the man Seravina Orcayne married.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTk1ZmY5YWI3ZjQ5NmE5MTIzMzEwZTQzNTU3N2U4">And a man he thought was still secluded in the Abyss, detached from the Alliance and its news.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTUzODkwMDRmODRmMzNhYzlkMDdiZDFiODgwOGJh">“You were supposed to bring our precious little granddaughter to join your family the moment she was found, where we would all eventually be reunited when I manage to find her parents,” Kaelthas says, still tilting his head while crouched at the edge of the table with his hands gripping the edge itself. “But what did you do? I hear the moment I finally step outside of the Abyss that you sat and watched as she grew up in poverty, barely scraping by.”</p><span class="cjViZTYzYWVlMzgyYjRkZmU4ZjJhYWI1YjFkNWY4ZjNk"><br/>Stolen content alert: this content belongs on Royal Road. Report any occurrences.<br/></span>
<p class="cnNjZWU4YTU5MTRlNDQ4YWM5OGY0OTMzYjEyZjg2Zjcz">Silence fills the room for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjY1NDc1YmQ5NTRhZmM5MzA4N2I3NzRmZmVjMTU4">“Did you enjoy that?” Kaelthas eventually asks, his eyes blinking as he tilts his head the other way and as several tentacles explode from his back to grasp onto the table under him. “Watching her suffer as we Krakens were stuck in the Abyss, searching for Seravina and Orvyn while believing you were actually looking after her?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MmExZWEwNDAxMjRjOWRhOGNlNDQ2NWRlMDg0Mjdl">Seravos transforms into a humanoid orca, growing several feet in height as his mouth and entire face transforms into that of an orca, his skin turns pitch black with white spots here and there with the skin of an orca, and a large fin grows from his back. Meanwhile water begins to flood the room, making the two Hydras in it create a barrier of flames around themselves.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzFhYmIzOTczOTQ0ZjE4NWVmM2U1M2FjY2U5MDE2">The patriarch of the Abyssal Orcas turns his glowing blue eyes towards the other Abyssal Orcas in the room as he growls out, “I had to clean up the mess left behind by the war.” Making all the other Abyssal Orcas in the room flinch at his words.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTExNGY4YTlhYzQ3MTU4NjEwNGViZTI5OTlmYmE4">Kaelthas turns his gaze towards them before focusing on Seravos again and finally straightening his head as he says, “You plan on making excuses?” His eyes narrow. “I am well aware that you were cleaning up the slop in the Orcayne family that was against taking in little Aqua. But you could easily have found and brought her in long before finishing with that. And you didn’t.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGQ2MDAxYWU1NzQwNzNhNGZlYTk3OWZhNjc4Zjdk">Seravos’ eyes flicker at that, showing hesitation.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjE2MDc4MTg0NDQ0ZDFhZGVmZjcxYWMxZGEzMTVl">“I thought so,” Kaelthas declares, his voice echoing throughout the room. “You’re the same bastard whose daughter ran away because you always prioritized the family over everything. Even your own emotions.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MWNlZWQ2MTA0NjRlM2Y4ZDVmZTIxNGY2Y2U2NDE4">Seravos erupts into a roar as he rushes forwards through the water-flooded room to grab the Kraken, only for the Kraken to leap backwards through his tentacles before forming another portal behind him as he soars through the water.</p>
<p class="cnM4OWRjMjA3YzQyNjQ5NDQ5MmQzNzg4ZmIyN2M0Yjg0">And right when he’s about to pass through the portal, he leaves a few last words behind.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTJmMWExNjFlZjQ0YTU5MmQyM2FiZmFmYmMyNDg0">“Maybe you should think about your actions as our granddaughter turns her hatred on you, <em>Blubber</em>.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YzkwODgxZjkzMTQyNjc4MzJiMmI2YWNiNDAxNDE1">Then he vanishes through the portal. Leaving the room in silence once more.</p>
<p class="cnNjOTZlYjc5ZDZhZDRmZTg4N2I4OTkxNzZmMjVhOWU4">Until Seravos lets out a roar of anger.</p>

<p class="cnNhN2ZlY2IxYjg4MTQ5YzE5MGE3NjUwNWRiZTA0Yzdk">Fucking abyss.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2VmNzdmY2E2NjRjNWY4MTYxYWZkY2E3NTcyYWU4">This is just stupid.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGVkODk3OGUxMjQ3ZDBiNTlmOTczYjhlYjRhMzk4">Ridiculously stupid.</p>
<p class="cnM5YmQyNzUwZjQ2NTRkMWNhYzNjNDZlNDgzOGNkZmZj">I ignore the chat that’s flooding with comments about the Kraken and Abyssal Orca families that have no doubt gone viral at this point thanks to that reveal of my family name as I walk down the street.</p>
<p class="cnNlZmY3OGExZTYxNjQ4NDc4N2NhYzNlZDBlN2VhNjgz">Fortunately for me, my little name problem didn’t turn into a major issue at the guild. What with it changing in front of a receptionist.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTljMDYyZjUwNDRjYmJiYTBiZTY3MDNkMDM2ZDVi">She just took it in stride and is either keeping it a secret or might even assume it’s just a System thing. Or maybe that I was hiding my name.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWMwNWFhNTA3ZDQwYWI4MjdkY2E4NDIzZjQzZTVm">After that we finished signing everything and she got me my official ID card.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTU3NWY4ZjlmMDQ5ZWNiN2QwOTk5NzNmZDZmODVk">Then she told me the location of that workshop where the tour guide is before sending me off with a smile.</p>
<p class="cnNhMmM0MzhiOGJjZDRkZmJhNjU0MjYxOGFhYzUzOGIy">So that’s where I’m heading now. Off to that workshop while feeling more than a little frustration at the lack of a venting target for my current rage.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTY0NjMwMmFjMTQ4YTg4MGZkYjYzY2E1NTdjZjk4">A rage that only grows in intensity whenever I look at the name on my status.</p>

<p class="cnM3MzZlNTk4OTkyMDRhMjVhMTYxYzIzMmE5YWIxOTYw">Fucking abyss.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTg4ZWIyYTk2MTRmZWY4YTg2MWFlZWQzMzgxY2Y1">At this point it’s obvious they know I am related to them. Which makes me wonder just how long they’ve known.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTBlNDNlMWM2ZjQ0YTU4ZDUyZDYxMWY5NmQzZDVk">All those coincidences over the years that just barely let me stay afloat. The free lottery to high school. The private tutor.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGQ2MzQwMWFlYjQ0YmVhNGE0ODQzYzFiOWMyODY1">Everything.</p>
<p class="cnM3MWQ5Y2NlOThjMzQ1OTViMDQ2NmJkYWM5NDQzNTZm">Just how much was their doing? And why didn’t they just bring me in then?</p>
<p class="cnNkZTk2ZmFmNDgzMjQ2NGE5MjhiMDFhZjQwNjM1MWI3">Was I some sort of embarrassment?</p>
<p class="cnM2NzQzYmIwNTM4MTQzYTQ4MjVjMmM4MjA1OGY3OWM2">I know the Krakens and Abyssal Orcas apparently hate each other. So is that why? Were they too embarrassed or angry at the idea of having a child in their family with the blood of the Kraken Bloodline in them?</p>
<p class="cnNiMGMxN2UyZDkwZTQ5ODM5ZDViZDI3MWEzY2E3ZWI1">And now that I’m useful, are they finally taking me back?</p>
<p class="cnNlNTliZmVmYThiNDRhMmY4YzczYWViYzA5MDdkZTdl">Fucking bastards.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmVjNmI3Mjk0YTQ2OTk5NDIzZDljZTk4OTEwYTA4">I continue marching through the city, accidentally startling anyone I walk by with my glare. An expression I’m not used to making.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjMyMmEzNGU0YzQ1YmI4MmFiMTEzZTAwYTE3N2Q2">It’s to the point that even the chat has noticed my mood and are asking what’s wrong.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDk5NTM4OWUyMjQzY2M5MTVmNGE2Zjg2NWNmZTIx">In response to that, I just kick a streetlight. Accidentally sending it falling over.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmJlMWZhM2IzNjRkM2RhODhmZmY4NzQ3MDYwOTk2">Fortunately no one was watching, and I don’t see any cameras. So I make a run for it.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDJiZWJmZWZjYzRmYjRhMDg2Y2Q5NDg4NDc1YzVk">At least there’s a benefit to this military street style…</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjBiMzVmOTI5MDQ5ODE4MzMzZDU1NDQ0NjE3Y2Fl">Eventually I arrive at the workshop and take a deep breath outside.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDYxNGM3NGM1YzRiNGE4YjQxOTQyZjQ0NzVkZDFi">Then I open the door and walk inside.</p>
