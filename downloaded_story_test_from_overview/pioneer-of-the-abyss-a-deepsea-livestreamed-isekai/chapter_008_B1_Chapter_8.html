<h1>B1 | Chapter 8</h1>
<div class="chapter-inner chapter-content">
<p class="cnNiNmJmM2FhODMyMDRlN2FiYTEzZmVjNWRjZDZlMTkw" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aqua</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNlM2YzZjFkNDBlMzQxMWJhYjdhM2JiZWY4ZjVjYjIw">When I open my broadcast system screen to check my mail, I find nothing on the official messages tab, over a hundred messages on the business inquiries tab, and thousands on the junk mail side. So I check the junk mail first, only to surprisingly find that there’s less toxic and harassment mail than there was before. Probably because people are getting more into my broadcast now than they were last night.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDJiNmZkZmI1NjRjYjRhODdhZWE2YjcwNzQ5NmM0">There’s less people here out of curiosity, for my Bloodline, and my looks now than there was then. With those people being replaced by interest in my activities and the undersea monsters here.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGY2ZTdkMTk3NzQ1OGJiMjI0ZTZhMTAxMzVkZmYy">That said, there is still a lot of toxic and harassment mail. So I clear those out immediately.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzc2MDE5ZmMyZDQ2OTJhOTVjYTFkN2ZjM2QyNWYy">Then I go ahead and read some of the fan mail just to see if it’ll boost my mood. Because, skill or no skill, this pain sucks.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDA2ZGFmYWZhYTRjMGI5OTNhYjViNWI4YmMxYmMw">And it actually does help a little.</p>
<p class="cnNkN2U1MjlmNTJmMTQxMjhhZGVkYWMzZjRhNzZkZWE0">A faint smile spreads across my face as I read one from someone who is apparently an orphan. A girl who was an orphan, just like me, and felt inspired by my story. How I managed to get a job and live a relatively decent life before being sent here and even awakening a Bloodline.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTMyN2Y0NzYyMTQyZDg4MWViODFjODcxYzMxZWM4">It inspired her enough to go out and try harder. And through that she managed to find a job of her own, which has significantly improved her daily life.</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2E1N2QzM2MyNDQyODViN2QyZjllOWE1OGE3NDI1">That’s nice to see.</p>
<p class="cnNlOWViYzEyYTNmMzQyYzk4Mjk1NmVjZTdiOTI1M2U2">She’s not the only one though as there’s quite a few of these fan mail. Of course, with the fan mail, there’s still some who mention my physical appearance. But those didn’t get cleared out because they’re not done in a harassment style and are just straight up compliments.</p>
<p class="cnNkNmM0MWUwY2FlZjRhZTBhNjY3MTBiOWY0Nzc5OGQw">After reading through several more fan letters, I move on to the business inquiries. Only to find that there are a lot more of, well, everything. Variety show appearance requests, ad and commercial requests, and even a couple drama and movie offers now.</p>
<p class="cnNhZThhMDQ2YjI5YzQ2OGZhMWU0ZWU3NWExYjZhOGI5">And, as expected, every one of the requests has something to do with the water or the ocean. Probably because my image is currently synchronous with the deepsea from my time as a Pioneer so far.</p>
<p class="cnMxYjQzNGYxNjQzNzRhNjk5ZjZkYzRjZWY0ZmE3ZTc4">Not to mention my aquatic Bloodline.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzUxNGJhMmQwZTQ0MDY4NGZjYmFmZTVhNDRkYzM1">The movie and drama role requests all involve me playing a scuba diver, swimmer, or some sort of underwater fighter in action movies or dramas. Meanwhile most of the ads and commercials are for products related to the water. Things like swimsuits, diving gear, underwater armor, or even aquariums.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTU3OGIwZjcxNzQ3ZDhiYzY5MTI3YThjOWRjZGU4">Out of the various offers the only ones that aren’t entirely water related are the variety shows. And even those still have several ones related to water.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjQ5YTk0YTcyNjQ4M2E4YjY1ZWNlOWEzYzMxMDA5">Regardless of the offer though, I still can’t take them. Not without having a safe place to hide my body.</p>
<p class="cnNkZmQ2MjFhYWQ3NjRlNmViOGEzYTYzZTQ2YzhjOWVm">At that thought, a possible solution comes to mind. One that has me grinning before I slowly begin to drift off to sleep.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzcyZjYwMmVlMzRiNmFiNGRjMDExMTdlYzM1NDkz">This might work…</p>
<hr/>
<p class="cnM4MWE0NGMzYzZjNDRhMjZhOWQ3NmMyOWFiYzdhYjVm" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Foster Pioneer Stadium</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnM2MjU4MzkwM2YwNTQyYzA5YWI0YmE2ZTg1Mzk2NGVi">“And it looks like Therisa is going at it again with one more attempt against those amphibians!” Rick Foster exclaims as he flies through the sky within the grand looking stadium holding a hundred thousand strong audience in the bleachers. “Her last two attempts failed, but lo and behold she fail a third time! Things come in threes after all, so this time should work, right?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YTUyYjk2MmJkNDRiMzM5MmM5YzFjOWZhN2UxY2Q3">Laughter fills the audience at the man’s words.</p><span class="cmZlMDczMmM5OWEyZDRhMzBiZjk1YzNkNjhmNmIyM2U0"><br/>The narrative has been taken without permission. Report any sightings.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM1OGM0NzM4Yzk3YjQwYjVhYWVhYzdjNmMyYTAxNjVk">Rick is known amongst the people of this particular city as a comedian-turned-commentator for Pioneers. So everyone who comes to this stadium knows exactly what to expect from the guy.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2NjNjQ1ZWY0NzQwZGFhNDYwNmYzZTY3OTVlMjY0">Of course, there are also some people who come for his looks. As the man is abnormally handsome in the eyes of a lot of women.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGUxNGY4YWQ1ZjRkZmY5ODlmOTg2NDIyMDU1ZTRm">And he’s not afraid to show that off as he is known to wear expensive outfits every single time he commentates live.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjE4MDdiZWU5ZjQ2ODY4OTI0MDQ2YTJiMWMzOGM3">Meanwhile the screen he is flying in circles around using his hover device shows a woman wearing mud-stained gray and green armor as she moves quietly through a jungle in the direction of a bunch of huts at the edge of a cliff. Making for the third time this very scene has been shown to the viewers.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzllMWQ4OWEwMzQ0Mjc5ZTBiZTgzYWJiNGJkMWUx">The only difference now is that she is a higher level now than before. At level four.</p>
<p class="cnNlYWZiMTc3MDE1YTRmMDBhZTIxZTZlNjE1YzY1M2Nk">But every previous time she attempted this, she has been thrown off the side of the cliff by the tongues of the large humanoid frogs calling these cliffs their home. Which has quickly turned into a meme across the internet. One that Rick isn’t afraid to make fun of.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGNmNmVjNWNiYzRlMWQ4YThjOWFmZjcxOWU1OGQ3">“So let us watch and wait to see if she will be tossed again or not,” Rick says while rubbing his hands together amidst the audience’s laughter. Only for a dinging sound to echo in his head, notifying him that a Pioneer he follows just went live. At which point he pauses and utters, “Oh? It looks like Lady Bloodliner has come back online!”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjVjYzY1NTE5MDQ1YjY5NTA5MGQ0MDI4NDk0Mjlh">Without hesitation, he swipes the screen on his floating device, making the image of Therisa instantly get replaced by one of Aqua. Completely abandoning his earlier words and plans, to the great amusement of the audience who has come to expect this ridiculousness from him by now.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTViZjQ4YTNmNzQyNTBhZjE3NmE5YzhhZGJlNTcz">“I really like Lady Bloodliner, ya know,” Rick says without missing a beat as the screen shows her slowly moving through the water. “She’s got a lot of interesting things going about her. Like her Bloodline. And her Bloodline. And her Bloodline. Oh. And her hair. But mostly her Bloodline.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYzMxMTQxMzIyNDQ2MzM5OTgxOWI3ZjFmYjRhM2Zi">Laughter fills the audience again.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2JlMGRlYzhkMTQ0MzRhZjk1ZWFjODFjN2IxNzNm">“But being serious, she really does have quite a few things the other Pioneers are lacking,” he continues, growing a bit more serious this time. “Her lacking facial expressions make for great comedy during fights, especially since she’s underwater. And her fights themselves are all unique since they’re, as I said, underwater. You can also see her tenacity just from how she continues to fight even while injured.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMGEyYWI1OTc5NzQ4OWY4OGQwNDZiNDNlMGI2ODIz">The audience grows a bit more serious at his words with quite a few people shouting agreements with him.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzU5ODA0NTE0ZDRjZGY4MjRjZjFhMWFhZmNlNDEz">“Although the fact that she still isn’t responding to any business inquiries is raising some flags amongst the people, so I hope she starts responding soon,” Rick states with a slight frown on his face.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTUzMWVkNmEyYjRmMmI4NWVlY2Q0ZGM5ODI2ZDU4">But as if hearing his very words, the woman on the screen begins to slow down to a stop not too long afterwards. At which point she faces where the camera angle is and bows slightly.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGI1YmI3NjFhOTQxMTg4YTNhNTU0YWNhYzU1YWVi">“Wait, is she about to do what I think she’s doing?!” Rick exclaims while leaning forwards on the hover device. “Yeessss!!!”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjNhZGNkOGVjODQyZmZhMDYyN2Q0YjE4YTVlYjdm">And he’s not the only one excited for this as similar exclamations echo out amongst the audience. Meanwhile Aqua’s livestream chat begins to go wild as well.</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2FmMDI5ZWNmZjRhMjViZDMzZWY2MzZkYzEzOGVl">All because it looks like she’s about to speak to them for the first time.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjU0NDZmN2I3ZjQyMzY4Y2UwY2MwNTIyMjgyMmJi">“Hello, everyone,” Aqua Fallen speaks directly to the audience for the first time, her voice pleasantly echoing in everyone’s ears with a very soothing tone to it despite the water she’s in. Another facet of her Bloodline at work making her able to speak underwater. “My name is Aqua Fallen, as you already know. And I’m only going to say this once.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNDJiNWI4OTlkODRmNjVhNmM1ZWVjMzJhYzU2ZjUy">Everyone’s attention immediately locks onto her words now after hearing that.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmZlOTVhNjMzMjRjZjI4MGY2YzQ5YWQ1OGI3NGUw">“I’ve seen a lot of people asking in the livestream chat why I haven’t accepted any business inquiries yet, so I’m going to clear that up right now before I continue with today’s hunt,” Aqua declares, her voice still sounding incredibly soothing to the ears for some reason. Which makes Rick instantly realize there will be people turning her voice into ASMR without a doubt. Even with the occasional hint of pain in her voice from her injuries. “I do not have a safe place to leave my body while I go to take on jobs, so I will not be taking any jobs until I have a safe place. It’s as simple as that.” She bows again. “Thank you for listening.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MmI4Y2Q2NWU2NzQzMzA5Nzk4OGE3NTE5Njk4MGQ0">Then she proceeds to continue moving through the tunnel in the direction of the large cavern with the monster environment.</p>
<p class="cnNlZGRjZDQ4ZTk1NDQyOWM4YTYwMzRjYzczMDc4Zjk0">Silence fills the stadium for a brief moment before everyone begins talking at once, making it impossible to hear anyone.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTg2MDgzZGM4MzRlOGM4OTBkYmUwMDJjYmY4YzFl">“And there you have it! The real reason Aqua hasn’t accepted any inquiries yet!” Rick shouts, his voice echoing out over the roaring audience. “A perfectly reasonable excuse at that!”</p>
<p class="cnNkNWIwNDlhNWQ0NDQ5MzI4YmZkYjA1MzBhYTIzYTRl">Soon, agreements ring out both from those in the stadium and those in the livestream. All taking Aqua’s side in this.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjVhMDY0NjNmOTQ0MTJiYWM2NzUyMmFjYzk5MjYw">After all, no one would be happy if she ended up dying just from some monster who snuck up on her while she was filming a photoshoot.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTM5NWEzNTgxZjQzNTVhNzczYmQ0NzZjNGUxMzRi">That would be boring, and it would end the fun that is these deepsea monster hunts.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTVkNjI2ODEyMjQzYWVhYjA0YjkxZDk2Mjg4NTFh">Then there are also the many fans who have already come around to the beautiful Bloodliner who would be upset at her death.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2M3NjliNzFlOTQ1NmNiOTI1MTNhNzIzZTE2NDgx">Rick included at this point.</p>
<p class="cnM0MzVlZTFkMmU2MzQ4MTZhZDFiMTRlY2I4NGZjNjdh"><em>Let’s see… I should sponsor her something myself when the ten day period is over.</em></p>
