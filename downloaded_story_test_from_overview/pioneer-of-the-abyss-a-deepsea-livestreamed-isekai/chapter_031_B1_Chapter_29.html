<p class="cnM4ZWJhNmMwOWFkZDQ4N2U4ZWEwY2ViZmYzMDJjZWM4" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aqua</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnMwMDUzYzc3MThkZjQ4N2RhOWFlMWMxNjcwNGFhYmI0">The jellyfish are all covered in blood red electricity forming what’s pretty much a net across the entire cavern, and it actually looks really beautiful.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTk3NmM0ZjkyYzRhOTg4MzRmY2JlMGU4MzU2MGI1">And really dangerous.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzZkMjRlMGFmMzQ0MDBhMjVlNmIyYTAzMGNlMmIy">Hmm.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTVhYTllMTlkNDQ5MzRiNWFkN2IyNzlhY2EyYjEy"><strong>[Deepsea Bloodzap Jelly – Level 14]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMxZGNhNjYyYTY4ZTQ4MGE4YzNlYzk5YzgzMTliOTAx"><strong>[Deepsea Bloodzap Jelly – Level 15]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM2OTc5NTY0MGM4MzQ2ODJiZWZiZGRiNTc4NGQ2NDFl"><strong>[Deepsea Bloodzap Jelly – Level 14]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMyYzEwOTkzYTYyNDQ1ZDliYmIzM2FmZjU3NThmN2Nm"><strong>[Deepsea Bloodzap Jelly – Level 16]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM2ZGNlMmY4OWE5MjQ4ZjJhOTMyZWI5MjgzOWVlMDkz"><strong>[Deepsea Bloodzap Jelly – Level 16]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM5ZmQ2ZjE5OTM1OTQ3MGJiYzU3NTRiYTBlMjMyZjI1"><strong>[Deepsea Bloodzap Jelly – Level 17]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMyYWI4ZTk4MjhiMzRjMTNiZGRhYjNjNGYwNjNkYzUx"><strong>[Deepsea Bloodzap Jelly – Level 17]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM4MGZlMmU3NGI5MTRiODM4MzNkMDgzN2JmNzcyNGE0">These things again. The same jellyfish monster I saw several days ago.</p>
<p class="cnM1OWE5ZjkzNGJlNjQyY2RiYmVlYjEwNjJkYTUyNmJm">Guess it’s time to squash some jellyfish again.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWUwMjhkZGI3ZTRmNDlhZjdmMTE2Y2I2NWZiYzFj">So I move as close to the jellyfish electrical net as possible before activating Abyssal Kraken’s Embrace over and over again. Making several large tentacles appear before moving into the electricity to swat the jellyfish. Literally bursting them the moment they touch them, showcasing just how strong I’ve become underwater.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzMwODdjMWVhMzRkZjM5MzBiYjIxMjM3OGYyOWI1">That or just showing how weak the jellyfish are physically.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWExZWUwNWM5MjQzYzY5NzllOGRjMzI2ZWJiNTVk">Either way, I continue having the tentacles smash the jellyfish over and over again. Giving me quite a bit of EXP and some REGEN stat points in the process.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzc0Y2YyNzY2YjQyYTk5NzhjZDJlYjIwOWU2YTUz">I’m really liking this tunnel far more than that last one which ended in a massive shark that wanted to eat me.</p>
<p class="cnNmZWZmNjI1NjY5NDRiNDA5MmY0ZjczZTNhOTMzNzg5">This tunnel is feeding me a bunch of EXP instead. Which is very nice.</p>
<p class="cnMyNWUxMWM1M2Q0OTQ2MmQ5M2FjOTlmM2YwYzllYTdm">The only problem with it is that it’s way too long.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzY0NjAxZjk3ODRlODhhZDMyNWY5ZmU4MTFjNjEw">At the rate the tunnel is going, it’ll end up taking half a day just to pass through the thing.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzY2MjJmYTQ3NzRmNGNiOWJjYjg2YjBmYmU5OWIw">And that just won’t do. I have multiple business appointments tomorrow after all.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGQxNDA1YmU4ZTQwZmJiMDUxODZjZGUwZGFhMDY2">Including but not limited to meeting with Oliver Ashfyre from Alliance Drama Center for the drama, shooting a commercial for some swimming gear, and modeling for the cover of some swimsuit magazine. Albeit one without incredibly skimpy outfits. The agency helped make sure of that detail.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjBkYzY0MzI0NjQwMmNhNmE4YjEwNDI5MTQ4ZGQx">The commercial and magazine, along with most of the other commercials, ads, and modeling work I have scheduled over the next couple weeks, will all release around the same time as the drama begins airing. And the music video I’ll be filming with that Jack idol guy will release around the second episode of the drama as well.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmJlZDEzYTEwYTQ1ZWZhYWQ2NDViNDFiNGI5NGQ3">All to work together and boost each other as a sort of debut for my career.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDhkZDJhMzY1MjQxYWVhNWUyNmI0ZTk4YWQwZjky">Speaking of that music video though, I’ll be going to that the day after tomorrow. Where they’re going to listen to me singing for the first time and get me a trainer depending on how well I do. Or how poorly I do.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDNmZDBiOTE1MjRlODNiMjFkZTQ1NGUzNTIzOWVm">It still feels so surreal doing all of this. But that’s a problem for tomorrow me to deal with.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzY1MDIwN2E4YTQ2MDU4ZTA2YzdhZDhjMjMyMDA4">Today me is hunting jellyfish.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDU3MTY0YzU1MDRhZDc4NTU5YjZjYzc3ZDJhZDU1">After the tentacles finish killing all the jellyfish in the range of their movements, they begin to pick up boulders and other large objects to throw at other bloodzap jellyfish. Killing them as well.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjNhOTY1NjIxZTQ3Y2ViMmJjNTk2MGRmNGU5YWYx">All the way until they completely run out of ways to kill the creatures before disappearing a few seconds later as their minute expires.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDNhMzcxMzZiMjRmOTI5Zjc3MTlkNmNhM2U1Nzdk">Okay then. Not a single level out of all that.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzhmY2RkNjBhNDQ2MjViYmRiNGFmZTBkNDE1ZTEx">Very disappointing.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZGQ0YTNlMzVjZjRjMjViOGU5MTVmZDFkMzA1YzNi">I did get plenty of REGEN stat points though. So there’s that at least.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzQxMzUzMjJiOTRlMWQ5MWRjMzM0YWQzMThjOGRj">Time for round two.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTdmNTNlM2M1NjQ0ZmNhOWU0YzdmNjMxNDdkMmQ5">Instead of summoning the tentacles, this time I go ahead and use the pressurized water. Sending out blades of it one after another that slice straight into the jellyfish. Making a thick red liquid spill out of them mixed with electricity that flows through the water.</p><span class="cjRlMWQ4NmJkYzhjNTQ5YTliNThhYjRmOTM5OTI4ZTE2"><br/>This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br/></span>
<p class="cnM4Y2NkNTZjNmE1NjRjNjQ5NTZlYjg2NjM1MWM1MjE3">Then I proceed to kill the jellyfish one after another using this one skill. Slaughtering the lot of them without pause.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjRiNzlmYTUwNTQ4MTViNTEyNjcyZGQ2M2I2Y2Jj">Of course, around halfway through, I finally find the System Message I’m looking for.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTk2Nzk2YWQ5NDQ5ODNhMWMzMTdhODFkMmUyZmE1"><strong>[Congratulations! You have now reached level 21! Your total free points have increased by two, and your mana stat has increased by ten. Allocate the free points whenever you please.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMzNWE1YjdjZDc4ZTRjZGViOWEzNzVlOGFjOGJhMzY1">After seeing the message, I pause in the slaughter to check my status and allocate the two free points.</p>

<p class="cnM4ZDVlMWYwMGQ2YjRhZjVhZTNhZTNmZGY4MTBhZTYx">Good. I’m very satisfied with my status now.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjcyNDAyYzFhYjRmYWZiMjUyMWVhYWY4YTE5MmJm">After all, most regular wounds like scratches and bruises heal within hours at this point.</p>
<p class="cnNiY2Q1ZDYzZDUxZDQ0MDFiMDY4NjhlZjEyNWUzZjgy">Even a relatively large bruise that would normally take two weeks to heal would now just take several hours to heal instead.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGUzZGUxODQwOTQxOTA4OTk3OTdmMDc0ZWZlNmY5">It’s only at this point that my second trait is finally beginning to pay off.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWZkNjhhMTM1MDRjMmVhZWFkMTY1MTM4M2NmYWI2">That aside, just four more levels before I get my next trait.</p>
<p class="cnM1N2YzYzM2NDVkNzQ3OWZiYThkOTJlMDE4MzJiNjE2">I can’t wait for that.</p>
<p class="cnNlZWZhZDc0NDFlYTRiNzI4OWY3MGYwOWJiMjJlY2Vl">Although I’m rather curious about what the trait will be.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzk0ZDNjM2YxZDQ5YmM5ZWM0MWMyYmJjNmE4N2Mx">Physique of the Abyssal Kraken obviously comes from the Abyssal Orca. With what looks like a slightly higher strength output than what the Abyssal Orca has and with a different name. Meanwhile Apex Predator of the Depths is from the Kraken side since it’s regeneration.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjYwM2MxMjkyYTRjMTNiMDM3NzlkYWU5YTViZjYx">So will my third trait be from one of the two, or will it be a merged trait? Something only an Abyssal Kraken would have?</p>
<p class="cnNiZDQxYzBmMjVlMjRiMzZhMjgwMjQ4MjViNmYzYzVk">Either way, I can’t wait to see what it is.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDU3MDI1NmJhODQwMWNiZjJlM2FlOWNmM2YxYWE4">Oh, and I’ll get another skill at level 25 as well. But the trait is more important.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjgyNzZlMjM1ZDRjY2Y4ZGQ3ZjFlZmFkZDk2YWI5">Traits only appear at specific levels after all, unlike the skills which are a lot more common. Especially at the lower levels like my current level.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzMxZDJiMmM3NTQyZjk5YzFiNThjMmMzMGJlNzNh">After a few seconds of pondering over what my next trait will be though, I go back to slaughtering bloodzap jellies. All the way until I finish clearing out the cavern of them. Then I finally begin to head back for the day.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzQzOWUwNGIyMDRjOWQ5NmUxZWQzMDIwYTE3OTMx">Because it’s starting to get late, and I still need to make it all the way back to my little home if I want to get enough rest tonight to handle the work tomorrow.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGViMzYwMmI0ZTRlMDQ5ZDM5ODYyYzAwNDAxOTg1">So I swim. And swim. And continue swimming for quite a while before I finally make it back to my little cavern, where I eat, take care of my usual routine, and finally go ahead and strip out of my armor to sleep.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWFmMjk0OWEzNTQxMDNiOWY2N2Y2MTMyNWU3OTAw">Because there’s no reason to wear my armor while sleeping anymore.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTJiZmU3M2IyOTRhMjI4NDQ4NGY0NmJmMWY3YjY5">It’s just uncomfortable. And since I’m safe here I don’t need to worry about being attacked in my sleep.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzM1NjExNzgxOTRlYmZiZTA0NjQ2YjM5MTcxNWYx">Then I go ahead and lie down before falling asleep rather quickly thanks to being tired from spending all day swimming and hunting.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDcxZmVkOGQ4NTQ3NjA5MDY4NWM0MzE4N2Q4YzQx">I actually sleep pretty well too, waking up early in the morning and sitting up straight while in my shorts and hoodie. And for some reason the broadcast turns on as I begin to stretch, with the chat instantly filling up and then practically exploding with comments when they see me without my armor on.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjA5OWIzODE2NjQ0NmJiYjY1NWM4MDEwODViODBk">Considering that nothing interesting is happening here, the System probably thought some of the viewers would be interested in seeing me early in the morning after waking up. So it went ahead and turned on the broadcast since I’m not actually against it or anything.</p>
<p class="cnNlNmZjNTYzMWY2MDQ5ODdiZjFjMDEwZmM5MTcyMTVk">Not like I have any problem being seen right after waking up after all.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTM5YzM5ZGQ5MDRjMzNhNzBjZTA5YzFhYWQ3MzVl">Some girls probably would be, but I honestly don’t care.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDZjMzBmOTlhMzRkYzBhOGRkNjUxOTFiZTgzODg5">Although…</p>
<p class="cnMxMjAxM2NiZWRkMDQ0ZTY5ZGJjNGVkZWQ1NzBjMzFl"><strong>[She’s so cute…]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM2OTk5NGQyNTJiZTRhYmJiYjNlYWU3NGZkM2E2M2Zl"><strong>[Hot.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNlYzdkMDNiZDVlYjRjMDY4ODQ3NmExOTQ3MTNhZGUw"><strong>[This is what she looks like in normal clothes? Wow.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnMwZjdlY2NmYTMzZDRlNzM5NjZhNWFhYTg3MzFiMzQ0"><strong>[She looks so good stretching like that.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNlOGZmNjM2N2VlNzQzYzZiYzViZjAyOWZkY2YyMmUz">…why are they all talking like that?</p>
<p class="cnMxZWZiODNiMGUxYzQwY2U5MzVjZGRhNmY4MTM2Zjhk">I stare at the chat for a few seconds before eventually just shrugging and climbing to my feet and doing a couple more stretches. And when I finish with that, the System stops the broadcast, clearly recognizing that I’m about to do something it shouldn’t broadcast. At which point I take care of my morning routine.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDQyYmEyNzhjMjRlMjZiODZhYzU5NGI3NWI2ZDQ3">Then, when I’m all refreshed and ready for the day, I go to accept the request the CEO’s email said to accept at this time. Going by the clock I got to tell the time, of course.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTQ0NTY3YmI0MjRkNDVhNjkxOWE3NDM4YThmOWI3">Time to meet Oliver and see if I have any talent in acting at all.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTU4M2Y4MTNkMDRhYzU4MTg0OWVhNzRhZGE2Mzhh">Which I’m honestly not all that sure about, but I’ve never actually acted, so who knows. It’s the same as singing.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjU0NTE0NmM0MDQ4ZGI5NTgzNGQzNDQxYjgyNjk5">I’ve never done either before, so I don’t know how good I’ll be at them.</p>
<p class="cnMwOGEyODc0MDFjMTQwYThhOWM4OTYzNTNjY2JlOGM3">Although this particular role might not actually have as much acting as I originally thought. Considering what Oliver said to the agency. Saying that rather than choosing me to play the role, he chose me because I am already rather similar to the character of the role. So not as much acting is necessary.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWUxZjI4N2YzMzRlYzY4Nzc4MmZiYjYxYWE3OTZi">Which fits the script and character he had in mind and gives them a chance to put me in a starring role to draw attention to the show right away.</p>
<p class="cnNkMGQxZGVkODNkZjRkNWE4NDBiZjlkYmQ5OWQ5Y2Nh">A win-win situation in their eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDk0YTRhMGFhMjQ4MGE5MWY3ZDVlZWY4ZDBlMzc3">Either way, it’ll be a first for me experience-wise.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2ZmMDAxOTI4ZDRiMTBiZGM0YWE3MTZlM2I0YzAw">So it’ll be interesting at the very least.</p>
