<p class="cnNhNmUzNGIyMmUwNTQyY2NhN2YzNjc4NjU4YTI2ZmM1" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>A meeting room in an oceanside mansion on the planet Aquarius</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnNkMWE4NDIwYWY1NjRjMmI5NTg4OWRjMzI5YzFlYTUy">Several screens play through the room as the people inside of the room watch them without saying a word. And on each screen, Aqua Fallen can be seen. Some of them being screens showing her fight against the shark, others her current broadcast after waking up the next morning, and others even show footage of her currently doing a commercial in a café setting next to the ocean. With her System Phantom not showing any of her current injuries, and projecting her with both of her arms still intact.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTZkNmNlZDhkZTRjMTZhZjFlY2QyMGRjMGI5ZGVh">The silence in the room stretches on for several minutes. But everyone in the room is already clearly aware of the importance of the matter they’re discussing.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTA4YjJkYWUxZjRiM2E5NDkyM2FlOTUwN2JhNzRm">Every one of the seven people in the room is a member of the family after all.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDVkN2JiZDdjMDQ0OTY4ZDQ5YWUzYTYzNDEzOTVl">And every single person in the room has very similar features to Aqua.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDAzYjhiOTU1ODRkYjNhOTVlNGE2MWQ2NDJlMzkw">Deep blue hair almost black in color with a single white streak going down their bangs and glowing blue eyes, albeit lighter than Aqua’s blue eyes.</p>
<p class="cnMyZmY5ZDc3YTA4ZjQ4ZDg5YjM5NzY5ODU3ZmE3MGM0">Meanwhile at the very front of the room, a man stands with his arms folded across his chest. Just watching the screen with a slightly lost look on his face.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzZiZWI1MmYzMjRhMjJhOGFiNDRkOTMxZDJlYmFj">That look only lasts until one of the other people in the room taps him on the shoulder though. After which he finally nods his head once.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDQ5ZDc2NGMyYzQ0ZjZhY2UwOTQzMDU5YjJjZjFl">“If it’s confirmed, we will begin,” the man, known widely by the people of the Alliance as General Orcayne, states in a gruff tone of voice.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjg2NTA0OThiZTQ2MzhhZjBiNmU0ZjQ4ZTllNzhm">All the other people in the room nod their heads in silence.</p>

<p class="cnNmMjYzNmQ5ZmEyNTQ5OTRiM2FjNGIzNzlkNzZmOGMw">Jaleth Aerwyn grunts at the sight that appears in front of him as he swims through the ocean wearing his portabreather around his neck to magically filter out any water he breathes and only allow the air through while underwater. That sight being a System Notification.</p>

<p class="cnMyYjFjOTQwNGUzYzRiMjdiZmUwNWFiMTE3YzJmNGRm">He shakes his head while narrowing his eyes, without pausing in his swimming. Then he goes ahead and selects the menu icon again for the leaderboards, making the leaderboards appear in front of his eyes.</p>

<p class="cnMwMTA3ZDQ5YTMyYjRmMWE5ODQ2YmVmZjVlODI5MWVj"><em>It’s that girl again? Who even is she? I’ve never heard of anyone named Aqua Fallen in any of the cities I’ve journeyed to…</em></p>
<p class="cnM1NDYwOGY1ZTcwZTRmNzNhNjY0NjJhNWM2YjBhYTU3">Jaleth has been traveling from one underwater city to another searching for the people on the top leaderboards in the hopes of gathering them all together. But while he has managed to find several of them, he hasn’t managed to find even the slightest trace of the one who has now beaten him out for the top spot on the leaderboards.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWQyY2I1Zjc2YzQ4ZDVhZmMzYmZlMTBhZWY3OWM2">His frown grows as his long black hair flows behind him while he swims in the direction of the large underwater city in the distance.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjM2ZWUzYzczMjQ1ZDE5OTA4OGIyMDk3NGYyYTM1">This particular city is one of the Deep Cities. A city beneath the depth of six thousand meters.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzE1Y2IxOGYxNzRhNmRiZmVhZGUxZTQ1YWQxODIz">The Deep Cities aren’t very safe thanks to their location being prime for monster attacks, but they are great sources of wealth. And now that this thing called a System has arrived to help them, they’re finally managing to get a handle on the monsters. At least somewhat.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjk0NDgwZDc0NjQyNWI4MWVmZWU3NTg0NjY0MWNj">But things would be a lot easier if he could gather all the top rankers on the leaderboards into one location to form a hunting party.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTMxZGMyN2FkZTQzMDJhMzY2MWNhMjhkZjg1NTE0">Jaleth sighs as the Deep City, known as Alaetras, gets closer.</p>
<p class="cnM3NThiMjI0NDk2NTQ3NDNiYzg5YTBjMjc3MDVkOWVm">The city itself, just like all the other underwater cities, is covered in a dome to allow air to flow freely within the city. Specifically so people don’t have to waste their portabreather’s charge while inside the cities and can even charge them while in there. But this particular city is structured more as a military style city with the streets all having at least one weapon store lining them, and the exterior ring of buildings all being manned with turrets atop them.</p>
<p class="cnNlODNlY2FhOTBlMTRhM2RhMzBiYjU1MzY5OWFmMjNl">A common sight amongst Deep Cities.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTczNTRjMTMwYjQwZGU4OTBkZGE0YTY2OGQ1NWE4">Jaleth continues swimming until he arrives at the city’s dome and passes straight through the barrier. Using his ID as a hunter to do so with ease. Then he begins heading towards the city center. Occasionally passing by other people along the way, many of whom give him a deep bow. Showing their appreciation for a hunter.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTgyMDU2ZDdjYjQ4YTQ4NzQ0OWEwYWU0MGRlMWMy"><em>I hope this city has news of the new first ranker. It’s the first deep city I’m trying.</em></p>
<p class="cnM1OTcxYWM1NGRiNzRkMjk4YjYzM2Y0MGU3ZWEwMjY3">But unfortunately for him, when he reaches the city center and asks about the girl, no one tells him anything about her.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDk3NmZhNGY0ZDRmNzdiNWQ4NzAwNmVkNDliZjRj">Once again he finds himself empty handed.</p>

<p class="cnNlM2VmYWEyYzZjYjRkYjc5YWFkYmQ5OWJjNjUwNDdh">“I’ve cut down on the number of jobs you’ll be working for the next few days, so please take it easy during this time,” Rhettfelt says while reading something on his tablet after we finish the commercial filming. Then he looks up at me. “And I mean it. Both on Oceana and here. Just because your System Phantom doesn’t show your wounds visually to us doesn’t mean they don’t still hurt while you’re working. If you push yourself too hard and end up passing out I’ll cut it down to one job until you recover.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMzBiZmE4MjI1NzRlNmJhZDYxOWZkMGU0Mjg0ODdj">I find myself being nagged by my manager CEO, surprisingly enough.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDM0ZDk0M2Y5MzQzOTM5MTA0ZjdmYmUwOTYxMjAy">Honestly still not sure why he seems to actually care about me.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2E2ZDE2NjJhMzRiN2RiOGY1NGFmMzcxYmMyZTU3">Normally people in his position would just use and toss away the Pioneer when they’re dead.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjM3YTJhYTkwMDQwMTRiZWQ2MmE2OWM5YzE0OTE2">Is it because I’m a Bloodliner?</p>
<p class="cnM4ODJmMzdkZDRmMzRmNDBhYjljNjI5MjJhOTRkOTVl">Probably.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGYzMzg1NjFiZDRlMmY4OTdjMzNmZjJiNDBkMDEz">“By the way, Rhett,” I start while tilting my head slightly, “why haven’t you ever asked?”</p>
<p class="cnM5YWYwNWM2NWM2MjQ5NDRhZTZmMjg3MjRlODY1YTky">He looks confused for a second before asking, “About your Bloodline?” And when I nod, he just shrugs and says, “Not my business. And more importantly, your Bloodline being a mystery makes for better PR. Since everyone’s trying to figure out what it is. So try to keep it a secret for as long as you can.”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGYwZTc5YzIzNjRmMGE5OGZiYjA0OGFmNjZkZWRk">I blink in surprise at that. Then after a second I mutter, “Sure.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDJlODQ4M2VmYTQ5YWE4NWQwN2VkOTlkYjQ4ZTBi">Huh.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjQ4N2I0YzU2NzRhZTQ4ZDQxNzczN2UzZjc0ODMz">Wasn’t expecting that sort of reason.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWRkNDFkNTdlYTRmNGNiODFlOTk5YTZlMzljMTIw">“Oh, and I was thinking we should reorganize your schedule around your arm until you can get a prosthetic,” Rhettfelt – or Rhett as he started asking me to call him at some point – says, surprising me again for a moment. “We also have several prospective sponsors for that if you would like to take a look at some point.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MDRlMmY0YzA0ODQzNmViYTk1Y2U1MGVkMDFmNGRk">I shake my head and state, “Don’t worry about any prosthetics. I don’t need them.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMTNiOWU0NDNkOTQ2OGZiMjg5Y2M5NjYxZDRhZmVk">He blinks at that.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzhjODcyNDZkZTQ0NTc4ZDRiZWRlMDQwMmU4YWNh">“And don’t worry about reorganizing the schedule,” I add. “As long as it’s not a job that requires the use of my arm for the next few days, I should be good by the end of the week for any job previously agreed on again.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZDdkMjVlNzNmMzQxZTM4NmJkNWYwNzQ2MmE1ZWJi">Now he is just staring at me.</p>
<p class="cnMzYmYxNzdlYmIxNjQyN2Q4OThhOGU0MTBiZDExN2Fh">I stare back.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzExYjA0ODQxMzQ0MmU4NzYxZDA0MzY0NWEwMDg4">We continue staring for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="cnM4YmMyMGNlNjY1YjRmMjliMTEwNWY2ZDQzMGQ1NzU0">Eventually he just blinks and nods his head, saying, “Understood.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MWNjNmRkMzBmZDRmN2I4ZjFjNWU3ODkyNGNiNmE2">And for some reason his face seems to be saying something along the lines of ‘Aqua’s doing Aqua things again’ as he changes plans he was already in the middle of changing by the looks of it.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTc4MmE0NDY2NzQ3ZTc4NGZlZjdmMjY3NTJmMmZj">Why do these people keep thinking weird things like that?</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTU3ZGY0ODNjODQ2ZDc5N2VkZTQ4NDYzYWRhYTQw">I’m perfectly normal after all…</p>
<p class="cnNkNjY2ZGRkM2EyNzQ5NGVhZmFkODI4OTkyNTYwMWNk">Anyway, the next job for the day is the last job for today. And apparently that variety show that I was going to film for can’t get another slot with the other Pioneers for another several days. Which makes for an awkward end for my first variety show appearance.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjg1NDg4YjkxYjQyYmVhYjM3ZDEyMWZlNTE2MTU1">Then again, it’s probably for the best. Since I’m pretty sure I would need my arm for that show anyways.</p>
<p class="cnNjZWExOTQ3YTNmYzQ3Mjg4YmM2OTU3NGM4Y2I4YTQ5">The next variety show I’ll be appearing on won’t need my arm though. It’s just an interview after all. So I don’t need my arm to do that.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzQ4ZTRiZjdkMDQ2OTg5Y2Y1MDkyNDFjMDRhNDQ5">After Rhett – I’m still getting used to calling him that – goes over a couple more things with me, he sends me off to the next job. Saying he would be there soon himself.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWMyZmE1Y2MzNDQxMjE5OWIyMGViZGM4ODQ3NTI3">So it’s time to do my very first interview.</p>
<p class="cnNmODBkYmQyNjQ5YjQ3NTRiMzlkMjkyNDQ1N2RlYzkw">I hope this goes well.</p>
