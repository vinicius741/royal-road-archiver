<p class="cnNkZmYxOGU4ZTBmODRhNTA4ZWIwZGFiYjVhZGY4MDBk" style="text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 1.1em"><strong>Aqua</strong></span></p>
<p class="cnMxYTA0M2Q5ZDVhYzQ1OThhZGFjNDVkMDgzMGU3ZWZh">I get my answer rather quickly when I look outside of my cavern to see a certain massive shark literally tearing its way through the tunnel, damaging the tunnel in the process and making the entire cavern tremble. Because the shark is now even larger than it was the last time I saw it.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjkzMThlZTIxNjRhNzE4MDM4NGJhNmQyNmY3Zjg4">As for its level…</p>
<p class="cnM0OTY3ZjdjNWQyNjQxYTg4M2VhOWUxOWIxOWQ3Njhi"><strong>[Deepsea Ripper Shark – Level 30]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM3YWQ3NjZmMDYzYjRmNDU5Y2U3YzI1YzExZTA5Zjg1">Yep. It’s risen even more.</p>
<p class="cnMyNGZiNzNmOTYwYzQzNWJiMmE5ZTY0ZTI4NWQ1MWU3">Damnit.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTMzNDUwNGE5NzQzMzk4Njk4ZmIxMmY3NWMzZjg4">What was it even killing? Most of the monsters in that large cavern were low level monsters that couldn’t possibly have leveled it up five times.</p>
<p class="cnM5OGNhYTJlNjQwMjQ3ZTNhNGRlYmI0MjhjMTNlYTlk">And here I thought the stupid thing was stuck there unable to level. Letting me finally catch up to it.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGRiYjFiNDFmZDQ1ZTBiYTg4ODI4Mzg0MTIzZTcx">I narrow my eyes at the shark from my little cavern up here, just to see the monster raising its head and looking up at me. Then it lets out several clicking sounds. Like it’s opening and shutting its teeth multiple times while its eyes narrow at me.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDFhZjAwMDMwOTQzMWM5ZGI5YzFhOGE1YzkxYzg3">The thing has definitely seen me, that’s for sure.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDJkNDAyOWY1ODQ5ZTZiNTEzZjU4ZmE5MWZmNTM4">It’s also no doubt strong enough to tear this wall down just by tackling it. Considering how it already started that simply by passing through the tunnel that was too small for it.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzdmZjNkYWM0ZTQzOGNhN2ZhMTU3NTAwYmU0YTdl">Okay then, how exactly am I going to deal with this?</p>
<p class="cnM1NzdiZmU3YTQ4YjRjYjg4MTlkYTg3ZGJmZWQ1MDE3">My wounds already largely all healed by now. So I don’t have to worry about that at least.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDgwMjZkYThiZjQwMTg5NTVhN2ExNjk0ZGZjODU2">As for my new skill? I haven’t even been able to test it yet.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzM1Y2MwNDA0NTRmYzc4MTgwMjk2ODNjMTEyZTdl">And my new trait isn’t directly combat related as it’s regeneration. Of course, I’ll be able to use it in the future in the middle of combat, but not now.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDM0ZTU3NWZlMjQ4MjFiM2Q2MmU5OTdlN2I3NzQx">My REGEN stat isn’t high enough yet.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjNkZjYzZmYxNTRmZTdiNjQ3NzczNTBkNmYwN2E5">I grit my teeth at the sight of the shark glaring up at me. Then I let out a sigh before grabbing my trident.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGU5MWM1Mzc2MTQ0NzY5MGM2Yzc2NDcwMDlhZmI0">It’s either going to wait for me to come down on my own, or it’ll force me down itself.</p>
<p class="cnMxZmUzMjE2OWUyMDQxMzliYWNlMWMyNWFjOTA5MTVm">And if I wait for it to force me down, I can say goodbye to my little home.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTMwZTEzMzkyNjQ3YWU5MjE3NDgzZDgwNzA0NzVh">I glance at the comment section while walking up to the very edge of my little cavern.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDc0ZmUzMWY2NTRiNWQ5MTVmNDg5ZTNlMjQzNzVl"><strong>[BOSS FIGHT TIME!!! YEEEES!!!]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM4MDhjN2Q2ZGRkODQ3ODBhY2I5YjU0YjMwNGFiM2Qw"><strong>[It’s Aqua versus the shark! A long standing battle in the making!]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM5ZjdlZmMxZjVmZjQzYzdiYjZkNjM5YzZhNDdlZGRi"><strong>[I’ve been waiting to see this for a while now!!!]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNkYjBjYWNmY2VmZDRlNmJhNzI1MGJjZDI5ZjQ2YzQw">Well they certainly don’t look worried.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjM4ZTgwNmYyYjQ4OTE4ZjBjNjdlMWY1YmZlZGM5">The corner of my lips quirk ever so slightly upwards before I turn my gaze back to the shark while clenching the trident in my hand.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2Y0MTM4ZWY0NTQ3YzRhNDMyNjRhMzk5YzIwMTQ0">If they believe I can win, I should believe that too.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTA5ZmM3Y2NjYjQ0YzNiZjFhODA2NDk5NGNkNzdi">Of course, this is ignoring the high possibility that a lot of them don’t care and just want to see the fight whether I die or not. But I’m not gonna think about that.</p>
<p class="cnNkNmYxNDMzYTE4YzRlMDZhNTcwOTVjZGQwY2I5ZTUx">Yeah. They just believe I’ll win.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzgyODM2ZmZmMzRlZTNiMjQwMjY5NDRmY2JmODU5">Without hesitating any more, I finally jump down into the water below. Instantly falling a few meters deep into the waters as the shark lowers itself back into the waters as well. Just glaring at me with its glowing blue eyes.</p><span class="cmQxYTMyM2RkZjRjZjQwMDFhZmUzYTAyNDE1YTc3Yzhh"><br/>If you discover this narrative on Amazon, be aware that it has been stolen. Please report the violation.<br/></span>
<p class="cnMxZGM3ZTYzNGQwMzRkM2Y5MTdhYzEyYmFkYzE1M2Y5">The shark makes one more clicking sound with its jaws before suddenly beginning to charge at me while opening its mouth and revealing rows upon rows of razor sharp teeth. And without hesitation, I quickly move to the side, managing to dodge the shark before it slams into the wall over the cavern. Making the cavern walls tremble again from the force.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2UwMmQ2ZGE1NDQwMjU4OTk2MzM4Y2MwNjM4NGE5">I feel my many hearts beating rapidly. My adrenaline running wild.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjE3MzM1OGViYzQ3YTM4MjUyNjg5ZWUwZTE2NmY5">Meanwhile the shark turns around to look at me again.</p>
<p class="cnMzMjQxMDZkM2U1OTQ1ZjE5YjQxZWRhYTU5MWVlZDc4">And without hesitation, the shark charges me once more, making me dodge out of the way a second time. Except that this time I stab my trident right into its side while it’s passing.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmEzZTRmMGZiZjRjMGU5ZjlmNjVlZjM0YjgyZWNj">Only for my trident’s head to shatter in the process.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2RlNzczMmIwMTRmZDM5NjJiN2U3YjA0MDZhMjJm">My mind goes blank for a moment.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGQ0OGEwNWE4OTQ5M2ViMzA4OTkxOThkM2ZjNzQy">The chat stops moving.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjljMjgwNjhkZjRmYTNiNmNiMTBiNmNhNTI3NThk">And the shark smacks me with its tail fin while passing by, sending me flying into a nearby wall as cracking sounds fill the water from some of my bones.</p>
<p class="cnMzODhkNzM4MGMwMTQwZWE4ZTllZWY1NDQzZjA1OTNi">I cough out a mouthful of blood before breaking out of the cavern wall I find myself practically imprinted in. Then I go ahead and fix my trident using mana. Since it could be useful later.</p>
<p class="cnMzNGU1OTliYzMxZTQxMDY5NDVjZTAzM2JlZmViNWEw">But instead of using it right now, I proceed to put it in my storage ring.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWJhYjY2OWYzYTRlYTQ5ZmJiNGNiZGNiNjE3NzJj">Because now is not later. And the only weak part I think I could injure with a weapon this weak is its eyes.</p>
<p class="cnM2NTAwZTI4YjRmMTQ4NDU5ODY1YjZhMmI3NmE3MWNl">My trident is made for level tens after all.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGJiOTg0YWQ3MDQ1ODRiNTIxZmM3OWU5YjkxNjY1">Not level thirties.</p>
<p class="cnM4Mjc3N2EyYjc3ODQzOGQ4NjRiMjcwYWVkM2U5NjQz">It was fine for the starfish, who didn’t have much in terms of physical defense anyways. But not for this shark.</p>
<p class="cnM1NmNkM2Y4ZmNhNTQ5MTNhNWNiYmQ5MjE3NTk2NTkx">And I can’t get a new weapon from a sponsor until level thirty either.</p>
<p class="cnMxNTNkYzRiYmM2ZTRjZTRhYTU0ZTJkOTZmNWQ0MWFi">Damnit.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWMwNDk4YzBhYzQ5M2Y5MjcxYzc0ZDc1ZmYwZmM3">This shark is moving too fast for me, even if it can barely turn. And it’s just as strong as me as well, with better constitution.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTRjNWFmYjRiNDRlMDQ5MjA0MDI3ZjY3YzYwZjNi">I grit my teeth before going ahead and trying my new skill.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTU3MmVhMjc4NTQ0YjdhMTAxOTdkY2NiYTZkMTY4">Pressure of the Abyss.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDhlYjE1MTEyZDQ4MmI5ZDk2M2JmNTdlZThiZjJk">The instant I do that, the water around me goes dark. Far darker than any of the water I’ve seen up till now.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGQ5ZmQxNGY1YjRjM2NiNmM1MTIwNDI0MGZlZGYy">Yet I can still see clearly through it.</p>
<p class="cnNlNDJmOGVmZGU1NTQzZjBiZDhmZTcyZDZlNDJiMGM4">As for the shark?</p>
<p class="cnM4NmMxM2Q1YjFhZDRhMmU5ODcyNzExOGJmYjVmNzBj">It charges straight at me, only to slow down the moment it gets within the range of Pressure of the Abyss. Giving me enough time to smoothly get out of the way and even slam my fist into the shark’s side. Sending it flying out at a wall instead this time.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDI3MjY4OTRiYzRlNjU4YzhmNTQzYTlmYWYxYTZm">The only difference between when the shark did it to me and when I did it to the shark is the fact that the shark left me with broken bones while I only left the shark with some dented scales.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTNmODA0ZTUyOTQwMGM4N2MxYTFiYjY3YWI2NjU4"><strong>[Oh, hell yeah! This is what I wanted to see!]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM5NWM4MzA4MTIwMTRjNDA5NWFlZmMyMTIwZTcyYWJm"><strong>[A fist fight with a shark! A fist fight with a shark! A fist fight with a shark!]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM3YjE3MzI2ODY3YjQzYzQ4NjM5OTc1OTViNzYzMjRj"><strong>[Another video is gonna go viral. I can see it now.]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM3ZTUwNGMzZWNiMDQxZWZiMzM3NjczODc2MjY3ZWY1"><strong>[What’s going on with the water around her? Doesn’t it look a little familiar?]</strong></p>
<p class="cnNjNGFlZWRkMWVkMzQ3MTI5N2I2NjFkN2U4ODNlZjcz"><strong>[KICK THAT SHARK’S ASS!]</strong></p>
<p class="cnM3ZjM1ZTMwZDU2ODRhOTk5NmExOTZlMjg1MmY3ZDNh">I raise a brow at the chat before putting the chat to the side and not focusing on it anymore.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTIyMTRlM2NmNjRiNDc5YmRmODYyNTEzMzdlNmRj">It looks like some may have noticed the darker water around me, but most of them are locked onto the sight of me punching a shark.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjJiZmRkOTc2ZjQ4ZTM4NDRiMTA0NzMyZDdlOTcz">The shark manages to recover, turning around and glaring at me as it does. Then it charges again, only to be slowed down by the pressure just like last time.</p>
<p class="cnMzM2IzZTcyNTVhZDQ4N2RiZTJiYjllNzRiOGU3Y2E4">When I try to slam my fist into its side again though, the thing actually spews out water from its mouth, pushing itself backwards a bit. Then it stops and tries to move forwards to bite my extended arm.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTVmZmQyZmUwNzRiNGU4ZDk3ODExYjZhOTg2ZGIy">I manage to pull back before it can do that though. All thanks to its speed being drastically reduced within this pressure.</p>
<p class="cnNkZmY1OWM4NGY5MTQ5NmNhNzdjOGYzYTcxYmY3NDhl">And after pulling my arm back, I counter its chomp by swinging my right fist straight at its jaw. Slamming into it and sending the shark flying several meters upwards with a faint dent in its jaw now.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTRkZjhkNmZhODQ1OGVhNTdlZTYxNzIzMjM3MTNk">The shark has me beat in dexterity, constitution, and probably even magical strength. But it doesn’t have me beat in physical strength. All thanks to my trait and the focus I’ve put into strength.</p>
<p class="cnM1OThhOWVlYzJkZDRmMTU5MDBhNjk4MDA2OTMyMGQx">And thanks to Pressure of the Abyss, on top of its terrible turn radius, I can slow it down enough for me to attack.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2I3YTY3ODM2ZTRkZjA5MTQxNzA0M2Y2ZGJhN2Q1">I can win.</p>
<p class="cnM4MGFiODg5MDgwODQwNDI5MTYxOTFlZDliZmM5ZmZk">Then the shark turns towards me again and opens its mouth before firing off some beam of high pressure water that slams straight into me. Sending me flying into the cavern wall with a grunt and a cough of blood.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODg3OTY1ZTRiYzRmNDVhMTIwOWFlMzFkYThiMmY0">I grit my teeth as the water continues blasting me, pushing me deeper and deeper into the cavern wall. All the way until the water blast cuts off, leaving me coughing out more blood. And when I look up, I find the shark lazily swimming back and forth close to the top of the water. Almost like it’s inspecting its work with a hint of smugness to it.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzg2ZGQ0OTQ4ZTRhZGU5ZTE4ODg5NTAwMTM3ODgw">Damned shark.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDg2YjJhNzQ1ZTRkOTc5ZDMwYTFlMjFlMDA3ODUx">I spend a little bit of mana to repair my armor again, which had practically shattered around the torso area thanks to that blast of water. Then I push myself out of the wall while again ignoring all the pain I’m feeling. Which this time includes several broken bones all across my torso.</p>
<p class="cnM5OGJkMzgyYzNkZDRkOWE5NzA5ZTRhOWZmMWUwYTgw">With some of the bones even sticking out of me. Mainly ribs.</p>
<p class="cnM2NmQ5NTQ0ODA3NDQ4YWZhNTI1Mzk1OTY4YTkxZWNj">At this point I’m used to pain though.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjdhODIyMzIyYjQ1NjBhZDhlMmI3ZGE4Mzc3MzRh">For some reason I feel some tears leaking from my eyes, but it’s impossible for anyone else to tell in the water. So it’s fine.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTY2ZjEwYzk1OTRlZjBiYzQxZjhhMGYyNTQ1ZmQy">I narrow my eyes at the shark as the thing stops swimming back and forth.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTBlNmExNGM0ZTQwMGViNWIyODRkNGNiMDc2Zjhk">Then I activate Call of the Abyss, summoning four deepsea orcas while I shapeshift myself to make several large tentacles tipped with mouths full of razor sharp teeth appear from my back. With my eyes gradually changing into that of the Abyssal Kraken during all this.</p>
<p class="cnNhNmNjZjEzOWQzYTRjMzliYmI2NjE5NTFiMGM2MDNm">“Playtime’s over,” I mutter out loud, my usual lazy and laidback tone now as cold as ice.</p>
